What are abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta – the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body."
What are the symptoms of abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"In most cases, an AAA causes no noticeable symptoms. However, if it becomes large, some people may develop a pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain."
What causes abdominal aortic aneurysms?,"It's not known exactly what causes the aortic wall to weaken, although increasing age and being male are known to be the biggest risk factors.There are other risk factors you can do something about, including smoking and having high blood pressure and cholesterol level."
How are abdominal aortic aneurysms diagnosed?,"Because AAAs usually cause no symptoms, they tend to be diagnosed either as a result of screening or during a routine examination – for example, if a GP notices a pulsating sensation in your abdomen."
How are abdominal aortic aneurysms treated?,"If a large AAA is detected before it ruptures, most people will be advised to have treatment, to prevent it rupturing.This is usually done with surgery to replace the weakened section of the blood vessel with a piece of synthetic tubing."
How can abdominal aortic aneurysms be prevented?,"The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm – or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing – is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels, such as: smoking, eating a high-fat diet , not exercising regularly, being overweight or obese"
What is acne?,"Acne is a common skin condition that affects most people at some point. It causes spots, oily skin and sometimes skin that's hot or painful to touch. Acne most commonly develops on the:face, back, chest"
What are the types of acne spots?,"There are 6 main types of spot caused by acne:blackheads, whiteheads (have a similar appearance to blackheads, but may be firmer and won't empty when squeezed), papules(small red bumps that may feel tender or sore), pustules(similar to papules), nodules (large hard lumps that build up beneath the surface of the skin and can be painful),cysts"
What can I do if I have acne?,"Although acne can't be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available at pharmacies. If you develop acne, it's a good idea to speak to your pharmacist for advice."
When should I seek professional advice about acne?,"Acne isn't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription. Your pharmacist can advise on whether you need to see your GP for further treatment."
Why do I have acne?,"Acne is most commonly linked to the changes in hormone levels during puberty, but can start at any age."
Who can get acne?,"Acne is very common in teenagers and younger adults. About 80% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne. Acne is most common in girls from the ages of 14 to 17, and in boys from the ages of 16 to 19. Most people have acne on and off for several years before their symptoms start to improve as they get older. Acne often disappears when a person is in their mid-twenties. In some cases, acne can continue into adult life. About 5% of women and 1% of men have acne over the age of 25."
What is acute cholecystitis?,Acute cholecystitis is swelling (inflammation) of the gallbladder. It is a potentially serious condition that usually needs to be treated in hospital.
When should I seek medical advice about acute cholecystitis?,"You should see your GP as soon as possible if you develop sudden and severe abdominal pain, particularly if the pain lasts longer than a few hours or is accompanied by other symptoms, such as jaundice and a fever."
What causes acute cholecystitis?,"The causes of acute cholecystitis can be grouped into 2 main categories: calculous cholecystitis (Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, called the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or by a substance known as biliary sludge) and acalculous cholecystitis (Acalculous cholecystitis is a less common, but usually more serious, type of acute cholecystitis. It usually develops as a complication of a serious illness, infection or injury that damages the gallbladder)."
Who is affected by acute cholecystitis?,"It is estimated that around 10-15% of adults in the UK have gallstones. These don't usually cause any symptoms, but in a small proportion of people they can cause infrequent episodes of pain (known as biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis."
How is cholecystitis diagnosed?,"To diagnose acute cholecystitis, your GP will examine your abdomen.They will probably carry out a simple test called Murphy’s sign. You will be asked to breathe in deeply with your GP's hand pressed on your tummy, just below your rib cage."
How is acute cholecystitis treated?,"If you are diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you will probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.Initial treatment (fasting (not eating or drinking), receiving fluids through a drip directly into a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration, taking medication to relieve your pain) or Surgery"
What are the possible complications of acute cholecystitis?,"Without appropriate treatment, acute cholecystitis can sometimes lead to potentially life-threatening complications. The main complications of acute cholecystitis ( the death of the tissue of the gallbladder, infection that could spread throughout the body, the gallbladder splitting open..) In about 1 in every 5 cases of acute cholecystitis, emergency surgery to remove the gallbladder is needed to treat these complications."
How can acute cholecystitis be prevented?,"It's not always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis, but you can reduce your risk of developing the condition by cutting your risk of gallstones. One of the main steps you can take to help lower your chances of developing gallstones is adopting a healthy, balanced diet and reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones."
What is acute lymphoblastic leukemia?,Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means the condition progresses rapidly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.
What are the warning signs of acute lymphoblastic leukemia?,"Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia usually begin slowly before rapidly getting severe as the number of immature white blood cells in your blood increases. Symptoms include(pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness, having repeated infections over a short space of time, unusual and frequent bleeding)"
What happens in acute lymphoblastic leukemia?,"As the number of blast cells increases there is a drop in the number of red blood cells and platelet cells. This drop causes the symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and increases the risk of excessive bleeding. Also, blast cells are less effective than mature white blood cells at fighting bacteria and viruses, making you more vulnerable to infection. Despite being uncommon overall, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common type of cancer to affect children."
What is the introduction of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia for children?,"Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer. One third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. Approximately, 3 out of 4 of these are acute lymphoblastic (ALL). ALL can affect children of any age but is more common in children aged 1 to 4 years old."
What is leukemia?,"Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are made in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some bones in the body."
What are the causes of leukemia?,"The exact cause of ALL is unknown. Research is going on all the time into possible causes of this disease. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as Down’s syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with ALL (particularly identical twins) have a slightly increased risk of developing ALL themselves, although this risk is still small."
What are the signs and symptoms of leukemia?,"As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells. Children may develop bruises, and bleeding may take longer to stop because of the low number of platelets present in their blood (which help blood to clot). Sometimes, children suffer from infections because of low numbers of normal white blood cells. A child is likely to feel generally unwell and may complain of aches and pains in the limbs or may have swollen lymph glands."
How is Acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed?,"A blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of the abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is usually needed to confirm the diagnosis. A sample is also sent to the genetics department to look for any abnormal chromosomes, and for a test called MRD (minimal residual disease) analysis."
What are the treatments for leukemia?,The aim of treatment for ALL is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ALL and is given according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen).
How do you feel about leukemia in children?,"As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support."
What is the introduction of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia for teenagers and young adults?,This section is for teenagers and young adults and is about a type of cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The other main type of leukaemia that can affect teenagers and young adults is acute myeloid leukaemia.
What are the symptoms of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in teenagers and young adults?,"Many of the symptoms of ALL are caused by having fewer than normal healthy blood cells in the body. Symptoms can include(looking paler than usual and feeling tired, bruises, infections, aches and pains in your bones, swollen glands, feeling unwell and run down, fever and sweats, headaches and visual disturbance)"
What are the causes of Acute lymphoblastic leukemia in teenagers and young adults?,"It's not known exactly what causes ALL. Research is going on to try to find out. Young people with some genetic conditions, such as Down's syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are at an increased risk of developing ALL."
What is acute myeloid leukemia?,"Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively, and usually requires immediate treatment."
What are the signs and symptoms of acute myeloid leukemia?,"The symptoms of AML usually develop over a few weeks and become increasingly more severe. Symptoms can include (pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness, frequent infections, unusual and frequent bleeding, such as bleeding gums or nosebleeds). In more advanced cases, AML can make you extremely vulnerable to life-threatening infections or serious internal bleeding."
When should someone seek medical advice for acute myeloid leukemia?,"You should see your GP if you or your child have possible symptoms of AML. Although it's highly unlikely that leukaemia is the cause, these symptoms should be investigated."
What causes acute myeloid leukemia?,"AML occurs when specialised cells called stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow (a spongy material inside the bones), produce too many immature white blood cells. These immature cells are known as blast cells."
Who is affected by acute myeloid leukemia?,AML is a rare type of cancer. The risk of developing AML increases with age. It's most common in people over 65.
How is acute myeloid leukemia treated?,"AML is an aggressive type of cancer that can develop rapidly, so treatment usually needs to begin soon after a diagnosis is confirmed. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. It's used to kill as many leukaemia cells in your body as possible and reduce the risk of the condition coming back (relapsing)."
What is the introduction of Acute myeloid leukemia for children?,Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer. A third of all childhood cancers are leukaemia. Less than a quarter of these are acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). AML can affect children of any age. Girls and boys are equally affected.
What is leukemia?,"Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. All blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, the spongy substance at the core of some of the bones in the body.There are 4 main types of leukaemia (acute lymphoblastic (ALL), acute myeloid (AML), chronic lymphocytic (CLL), chronic myeloid (CML))"
What is acute myeloid leukemia?,Acute myeloid leukaemia is an overproduction of immature myeloid white blood cells (blast cells).
What causes Acute myeloid leukemia in children?,"The exact cause of AML is unknown. Research into possible causes of this disease is ongoing. Children with certain genetic disorders, such as Down’s syndrome or Li-Fraumeni syndrome, are known to have a higher risk of developing leukaemia. Brothers and sisters of a child with AML have a slightly increased risk of developing it, although this risk is still small. Other non-cancerous conditions, such as aplastic anaemia or the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), may increase a child’s risk of developing AML."
What are the signs and symptoms of Acute myeloid leukemia in children?,"As the leukaemia cells multiply in the bone marrow, the production of normal blood cells is reduced. Children may therefore become tired and lethargic because of anaemia, which is caused by a lack of red blood cells. At first, the symptoms are just like those of a viral infection, but when they continue for more than a week or two, the diagnosis usually becomes clear."
How is Acute myeloid leukemia diagnosed in children?,A blood test usually shows low numbers of normal white blood cells and the presence of abnormal leukaemia cells. A sample of bone marrow is needed to confirm the diagnosis. The bone marrow sample is also examined to check for any abnormalities in the chromosomes of the leukaemia cells.
What are the treatments for Acute myeloid leukemia in children?,"The aim of treatment for AML is to destroy the leukaemia cells and enable the bone marrow to work normally again. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for AML. Usually a combination of chemotherapy drugs is given, according to a treatment plan (often called a protocol or regimen)."

We do know some things might increase the risk of AML:some genetic conditions, like Down's Syndrome (a genetic condition is something you are born with) ,some non-cancerous conditions of the bone marrow, such as aplastic anaemia or myelodysplastic syndromes."
What is acute pancreatitis?,Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time. The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage.
When should I seek medical help for acute pancreatitis?,"Contact your GP immediately if you suddenly develop severe abdominal pain. If this isn't possible, contact your local out-of-hours service for advice."
Why does acute pancreatitis occur?,"It's thought that acute pancreatitis occurs when a problem develops with some of the enzymes (chemicals) in the pancreas, which causes them to try to digest the organ. Acute pancreatitis is most often linked to gallstones and alcohol consumption"
Who is affected by acute pancreatitis?,"Acute pancreatitis is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it can affect people of any age. Men are more likely to develop alcohol-related pancreatitis, while women are more likely to develop it as a result of gallstones."
How is acute pancreatitis treated?,"Treatment for acute pancreatitis focuses on supporting the functions of the body until the inflammation has passed. This usually involves admission to hospital so you can be given fluids into a vein (intravenous fluids), as well as pain relief, nutritional support and oxygen through tubes into your nose."
What are the complications of acute pancreatitis?,"About 4 out of 5 cases of acute pancreatitis improve quickly and don't cause any serious further problems. However, 1 in 5 cases are severe and can result in life-threatening complications, such as multiple organ failure."
What is Addison's disease?,"Addison’s disease (also known as primary adrenal insufficiency or hypoadrenalism) is a rare disorder of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are two small glands that sit on top of the kidneys. They produce essential hormones: cortisol, aldosterone and adrenaline."
Why does Addison's disease occur?,"The condition is usually the result of a problem with the immune system, which causes it to attack the outer layer of the adrenal gland (the adrenal cortex), disrupting the production of steroid hormones aldosterone and cortisol. It's not clear why this happens, but it's responsible for 70-90% of cases in the UK."
How is Addison's disease treated?,"Addison’s disease is treated with medication to replace the missing hormones. You'll need to take the medication for the rest of your life. With treatment, symptoms of Addison's disease can largely be controlled. Most people with the condition live a normal lifespan and are able to live an active life, with few limitations."
What is alcohol-related liver disease?,Alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake. There are several stages of severity and a range of associated symptoms.
How does alcohol affect the liver?,"With the exception of the brain, the liver is the most complex organ in the body.The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver."
What are the stages of alcohol-related liver disease?,"There are 3 main stages of ARLD, although there's often an overlap between each stage. These stages are explained below."
What is alcoholic fatty liver disease?,"Drinking a large amount of alcohol, even for just a few days, can lead to a build-up of fats in the liver. This is called alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is the first stage of ARLD."
What is alcoholic hepatitis?,"Alcoholic hepatitis – which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis – is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period. When this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol."
What is cirrhosis?,"Cirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms. It's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy."
How is alcohol-related liver disease treated?,"There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD. The main treatment is to stop drinking, preferably for the rest of your life. This reduces the risk of further damage to your liver and gives it the best chance of recovering."
What are the complications of alcohol-related liver disease?,"Death rates linked to ARLD have risen considerably over the last few decades. Alcohol is now one of the most common causes of death in the UK, along with smoking and high blood pressure."
How can alcohol-related liver disease be prevented?,"The most effective way to prevent ARLD is to stop drinking alcohol or stick to the recommended limits. Even if you've been a heavy drinker for many years, reducing or stopping your alcohol intake will have important short- and long-term benefits for your liver and overall health."
What is allergic rhinitis?,"Allergic rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose caused by an allergen, such as pollen, dust, mould, or flakes of skin from certain animals. It's a very common condition, estimated to affect around one in every five people."
What are the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis?,"Allergic rhinitis typically causes cold-like symptoms, such as sneezing, itchiness and a blocked or runny nose. These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen.The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time, but this can take many years and it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely."
When should I see my doctor about allergic rhinitis?,"Visit your GP if the symptoms of allergic rhinitis are disrupting your sleep, preventing you carrying out everyday activities, or adversely affecting your performance at work or school."
What causes allergic rhinitis?,"Allergic rhinitis is caused by the immune system reacting to an allergen as if it were harmful. Common allergens that cause allergic rhinitis include pollen – this type of allergic rhinitis is known as hay fever – as well as mould spores, house dust mites, and flakes of skin or droplets of urine or saliva from certain animals."
How can allergic rhinitis be treated and prevented?,"It's difficult to completely avoid potential allergens, but you can take steps to reduce exposure to a particular allergen you know or suspect is triggering your allergic rhinitis. This will help improve your symptoms."
What are some further problems associated with allergic rhinitis?,"Allergic rhinitis can lead to complications in some cases. These include: nasal polyps - sinusitis - middle ear infections . These problems can often be treated with medication, although surgery is sometimes needed in severe or long-term cases."
What is the information about allergies?,"An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance. Allergies are very common. They're thought to affect more than 1 in 4 people in the UK at some point in their lives. They are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren't previously allergic to."
What are common allergies?,Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. The more common allergens include: grass and tree pollen - dust mites - animal dander - food - insect bites and stings - medication - latex - mould - household chemicals . Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren't allergic to them.
What are the symptoms of an allergic reaction?,"Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen.They can cause (sneezing, a runny or blocked nose, red, itchy, watery eyes, wheezing and coughing, a red, itchy rash, worsening of asthma or eczema symptoms). Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment."
How can I get help for my allergies?,"If your pharmacist thinks you might have a mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. See your pharmacist if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction can also be caused by other conditions. Your pharmacist can help determine whether it's likely you have an allergy."
How can I manage an allergy?,"In many cases, the most effective way of managing an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible.  For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it."
What causes allergies?,"Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful.It's not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema."
What is the information about Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting an estimated 850,000 people. Dementia is a progressive neurological disease which affects multiple brain functions, including memory."
What are the signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive condition, which means the symptoms develop gradually and become more severe over the course of several years. It affects multiple brain functions. The first sign of Alzheimer's disease is usually minor memory problems. For example, this could be forgetting about recent conversations or events, and forgetting the names of places and objects.  As the condition develops, memory problems become more severe and further symptoms can develop, such as:  confusion, disorientation and getting lost in familiar places  difficulty planning or making decisions  problems with speech and language  problems moving around without assistance or performing self-care tasks  personality changes, such as becoming aggressive, demanding and suspicious of others  hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there) and delusions (believing things that are untrue)  low mood or anxiety."
Who is affected by Alzheimer's disease?,"Alzheimer's disease is most common in people over the age of 65, and affects slightly more women than men. The risk of Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia increases with age, affecting an estimated 1 in 14 people over the age of 65 and 1 in every 6 people over the age of 80."
How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed?,"As the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease progress slowly, it can be difficult to recognise that there's a problem. Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. However, a timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help."
How is Alzheimer's disease treated?,"There's no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medication is available that can help relieve some of the symptoms and slow down the progression of the condition in some people."
What is the outlook for Alzheimer's disease?,"On average, people with Alzheimer's disease live for around 8 to 10 years after they start to develop symptoms. However, this can vary considerably from person to person. Some people with the condition will live longer than this, but others will not."
Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented?,"As the exact cause of Alzheimer's disease isn't clear, there's no known way to prevent the condition. However, there are things you can do that may reduce your risk or delay the onset of dementia, such as stopping smoking and cutting down on alcohol, eating a healthy, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically fit and mentally active."
what is anal cancer?,Anal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the very end of the large bowel.
What are the symptoms of anal cancer?,"The symptoms of anal cancer are often similar to more common and less serious conditions affecting the anus, such as piles (haemorrhoids) and anal fissures (small tears or sores). Symptoms of anal cancer can include: bleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding) - itching and pain around the anus - small lumps around the anus - a discharge of mucus from the anus - loss of bowel control (bowel incontinence)"
How is anal cancer diagnosed?,Your GP will usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. They may feel your tummy and carry out a rectal examination. This involves your doctor inserting a gloved finger into your bottom so they can feel any abnormalities. Your GP will refer you to hospital if they think further tests are necessary.
How is anal cancer treated?,The main treatments used for anal cancer are the chemoradiation – a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the surgery – to remove a tumour or a larger section of bowel
What causes anal cancer?,"The exact cause of anal cancer is unknown, although a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition."
what is the information about anaphylaxis?,"Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can develop rapidly. It is also known as anaphylactic shock."
What should I do in the event of anaphylaxis?,"Anaphylaxis should always be treated as a medical emergency. If available, an injection of a medicine called adrenaline should be given as soon as possible.  Some people with a previous history of anaphylaxis will have an auto-injector of adrenaline. This should be injected into their outer thigh muscle and held in place for 5 to 10 seconds. Instructions for how to use these auto-injectors can be found on the side of each device."
What are the causes and triggers of anaphylaxis?,"Anaphylaxis is the result of your body's immune system overreacting to a harmless substance, such as food. Substances that trigger allergic reactions are known as allergens. Anaphylaxis usually develops within minutes of contact with an allergen, but sometimes the reaction can happen up to 4 hours later."
How can further episodes of anaphylaxis be prevented?,"If you know what has triggered anaphylaxis, it's important to take steps to avoid exposure to similar triggers. You should be referred to a specialist allergy clinic to either find out your allergy triggers or, if you already know what causes it, for further assessment and advice about how to avoid allergens in the future."
Who is affected by anaphylaxis?,"Anaphylaxis is not common, but people of all ages can be affected. People with other allergic conditions, such as asthma or the allergic skin condition atopic eczema, are most at risk of developing anaphylaxis."
what is the information about angioedema?,"Angioedema is the swelling of the deeper layers of the skin, caused by a build-up of fluid. The symptoms of angioedema can affect any part of the body, but swelling usually affects the eyes, lips, genitals, hands and feet"
Why does angioedema happen?,"The cause of angioedema depends on the type you have. There are 4 main types of angioedema ( allergic angioedema, idiopathic angioedema, drug-induced angioedema, hereditary angioedema)"
Who is affected by angioedema?,"Angioedema is a common condition, affecting about 10-20% of people during their life, although some types are more common than others."
How is angioedema diagnosed?,"Your doctor can diagnose angioedema by examining the affected skin and discussing symptoms. However, further tests, such as blood tests or allergy tests, may be required to determine the type of angioedema."
How is angioedema treated?,"Although most cases of angioedema get better without treatment after a few days, medication is often used.For cases of allergic and idiopathic angioedema, antihistamines and oral steroids (steroid tablets) can be used to relieve the swelling."
what is the information about ankylosing spondylitis?,Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the spine and other areas of the body become inflamed.
When should I seek medical advice for ankylosing spondylitis?,"You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of AS. If your GP thinks you may have the condition, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in conditions affecting muscles and joints) for further tests and any necessary treatment."
What causes ankylosing spondylitis?,"In AS, various areas of the spine and other joints become inflamed. As well as causing pain, stiffness and swelling, this inflammation can damage affected areas of the body over time, and in some cases can lead to some of the individual bones of the spine fusing (joining together). This fusing of the spine is known as ankylosis."
Who is affected by ankylosing spondylitis?,"AS tends to first develop in teenagers and young adults. Most cases first start in people aged 20-30, with only a minority of cases first affecting adults over 45. AS is around three times more common in men than in women."
How is ankylosing spondylitis treated?,"There is no cure for AS and it is not possible to reverse the damage caused by the condition. However, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms and help prevent or delay its progression."
what is the information about Anorexia nervosa?,"Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder and a serious, potentially life-threatening, mental health condition. People who have anorexia are very anxious about their weight and body shape. They try to keep their weight as low as possible by strictly controlling and limiting what they eat. Many people with anorexia will also exercise excessively. They may also use other methods to try to control their weight, including using laxatives, vomiting after eating, and taking stimulant drugs."
How common is anorexia?,"Despite being an uncommon condition, anorexia is the leading cause of mental health-related deaths. Anorexia can affect anyone – it’s more common in girls and women, with 1 in 100 women affected over the course of their lifetime. For men and boys, anorexia affects approximately 1 in 350 men over the course of their lifetime, and experts advise that it’s becoming more common."
How is anorexia treated?,"It can be difficult for people with anorexia to recognise that they have a mental health condition. Because it’s hard for them to get out of the habits they’ve developed as a result of anorexia, recovery can take some time."
What is the introduction of Anxiety?,"Anxiety is a feeling of unease, such as worry or fear, that can be mild or severe. Everyone has feelings of anxiety at some point in their life. For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.  Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia)."
What is generalised anxiety disorder?,"GAD is a long-term condition that causes you to feel anxious about a wide range of situations and issues, rather than one specific event."
When should I see my doctor about generalized anxiety disorder?,"Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, you should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress."
What causes generalized anxiety disorder?,"The exact cause of GAD is not fully understood, although it's likely that a combination of several factors plays a role."
Who is affected by generalized anxiety disorder?,GAD is a common condition estimated to affect about 1 in every 25 people in the UK.
How is generalized anxiety disorder treated?,"GAD can have a significant effect on your daily life, but several different treatments are available that can help ease your symptoms. These include: psychological therapy and medication"
What is the information about appendicitis?,"Appendicitis is a painful swelling of the appendix. The appendix is a small, thin pouch about 5-10cm (2-4 inches) long. It's connected to the large intestine, where stools (faeces) are formed."

How is arthritis treated?,"There's no cure for arthritis, but there are many treatments that can help slow down the condition."
What is the information about asbestosis?,"Asbestosis is a chronic (long-term) lung condition caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos. Asbestos is a general term for a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres. In the past, it was widely used in construction."
What are the symptoms of asbestosis?,"Breathing in asbestos fibres may eventually scar the lungs of some people, which can lead to a number of symptoms, including: shortness of breath - a persistent cough -wheezing - fatigue (extreme tiredness) - chest pain - in more advanced cases, clubbed (swollen) fingertips"
How is asbestosis treated?,"There is no cure for asbestosis once it has developed, because it is not possible to reverse the damage to the lungs."
How can asbestosis be prevented?,"There are three main types of asbestos that were used in construction. Two of these – called crocidolite and amosite – were banned in 1985 (although voluntary bans came into force earlier than this) and the use of the third type (chrysotile) was widely banned in 1999.  However, despite these strict regulations having been in place for a number of years, large amounts of asbestos are still found in many older buildings."
Who is affected by asbestosis?,"Asbestosis is a relatively rare condition, because it takes a considerable degree of asbestos exposure to cause it, and regulations to restrict exposure have been in place for many years."
What is the information about asthma?,"Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness."
What causes asthma?,"Asthma is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, called bronchi, which carry air in and out of the lungs. If you have asthma, the bronchi will be inflamed and more sensitive than normal."
Who is affected by asthma?,That's the equivalent of 1 in every 12 adults and 1 in every 11 children. Asthma in adults is more common in women than men.
How is asthma treated?,"While there is no cure for asthma, there are a number of treatments that can help control the condition. Treatment is based on two important goals, which are: relieving symptoms and preventing future symptoms and attacks"
What is the information about atopic eczema?,"Atopic eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of eczema. It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults.

How is Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder treated?,"Although there's no cure for ADHD, it can be managed with appropriate educational support, advice and support for parents and affected children, alongside medication, if necessary."
How is it like to live with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder?,"Looking after a child with ADHD can be challenging, but it's important to remember that they can't help their behaviour. Adults with ADHD may also find they have similar problems, and some may have issues with drugs, crime and employment."
What is the information about autism?,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), usually called autism, is something you’re born with. Autism means that the way you think about and experience the world is different to most people. This means you can behave differently to most people, and have different strengths and difficulties. For example, some autism characteristics (things you think, feel and do) can make it hard to express yourself in social situations, but you may also be particularly knowledgeable and passionate about topics that interest you."
What is autism like?,"Many people who have been diagnosed with autism prefer using the term ‘autistic’ to describe themselves – this is known as identity-first language (for example, “I’m autistic”). They consider autism to be part of their identity, not a condition to be treated."
How common is autism?,"Autism is always present from birth, but it might not be recognised or diagnosed until adulthood. Early intervention, in the form of support for their individual needs, can be helpful for autistic children."
What is the information about Bacterial vaginosis?,Bacterial vaginosis is not a sexually transmitted infection. It's an imbalance of the usual bacteria found in the vagina. It can cause an abnormal vaginal discharge which can smell fishy and unpleasant.
How do you get bacterial vaginosis?,Bacteria called lactobacilli naturally live in your vagina and stop other bacteria from growing there. Sometimes the balance of these bacteria changes. If this happens you can develop bacterial vaginosis.
What are the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?,"Often there are no symptoms of bacterial vaginosis. Some women may notice a change in the normal secretions from the vagina.  This discharge will usually be white or grey, thin or watery and have a strong, unpleasant fishy smell. This can be more noticeable during and after sex, and during periods.  Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause itching or irritation."
How is bacterial vaginosis tested? ,If you think you have bacterial vaginosis you can make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services.
How is bacterial vaginosis treated?,"Bacterial vaginosis is treated with antibiotics. An antibiotic cream or gel to use in the vagina may be given instead of antibiotic tablets by mouth. While you're there, make sure you tell the doctor or nurse if you: are pregnant, think you might be pregnant, are breastfeeding ,These may affect the type of treatment you're given."
How can you avoid passing on bacterial vaginosis to a partner?,"You can still have sex while you are being treated for bacterial vaginosis because it's not sexually transmitted. However, antibiotics and cream can affect condoms and other contraception. Speak to your doctor or pharmacist who can give you further information."
How can you reduce the risk of getting bacterial vaginosis?,"The causes of bacterial vaginosis are not fully understood, so it may not be possible to completely prevent it. However, you may be able to lower your risk of developing it."

How common is benign prostate enlargement?,Benign prostate enlargement is a condition associated with ageing and is common in men and anyone with a prostate over 50 years of age.
what is bile duct cancer?,"Bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma) is a rare but aggressive type of cancer. The bile duct system, or 'biliary' system, is made up of a series of tubes that begin in the liver and end in the small intestine. Bile is a fluid the digestive system uses to help break down fats and digest foods."
What are the symptoms of bile duct cancer?,"In most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can include: jaundice – yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, itchy skin, pale stools and dark-coloured urine, unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain"
Why does bile duct cancer happen?,"The exact cause of bile duct cancer is unknown. However, some things may increase your chances of developing the condition. The most common include being over 65 years old or having a rare chronic liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)."
What are the types of bile duct cancer?,"There are 2 main types of bile duct cancer, depending on where the cancer begins:  cancer that starts in a part of the bile duct inside the liver is known as intrahepatic bile duct cancer  cancer that starts in part of the bile duct outside the liver is known as extrahepatic bile duct cancer"
How is bile duct cancer diagnosed?,"Cancer of the bile duct can be difficult to diagnose, so you may need several tests. You may also need a biopsy. This involves removing a small sample of tissue so it can be studied under a microscope. However, in some cases, your surgeon may prefer to remove the suspected tumour based on the results of your scans alone."
How is bile duct cancer treated?,"Cancer of the bile duct can usually only be cured if cancerous cells haven't spread. If this is the case, some or all of the bile duct may be removed."
Who is affected by bile duct cancer?,Most cases of bile duct cancer occur in people over the age of 65. The condition affects men and women almost equally.
Can bile duct cancer be prevented?,"There are no guaranteed ways to avoid getting bile duct cancer, but you can reduce your chances of developing it."

what is bladder cancer?,"Bladder cancer is where a growth of abnormal tissue, known as a tumour, develops in the bladder lining. In some cases, the tumour spreads into the surrounding muscles."
What are the types of bladder cancer?,"Once diagnosed, bladder cancer can be classified by how far it has spread. If the cancerous cells are contained inside the lining of the bladder, doctors describe it as non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This is the most common type of bladder cancer, accounting for 7 out of 10 cases. Most people don't die as a result of this type of bladder cancer."
Why does bladder cancer happen?,"Most cases of bladder cancer appear to be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which lead to abnormal changes in the bladder's cells over many years. Tobacco smoke is a common cause and it's estimated that half of all cases of bladder cancer are caused by smoking."
How is bladder cancer treated?,"In cases of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, it's usually possible to remove the cancerous cells while leaving the rest of the bladder intact."
Who is affected by bladder cancer?,"Bladder cancer is more common in older adults, with more than half of all new cases diagnosed in people aged 75 and over."
What is sepsis?,"Sepsis is a rare but serious complication of an infection. Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to multiple organ failure and death."
What causes a sepsis infection?,"An infection can spread to other parts of the body if the immune system is weak or an infection is severe. Widespread inflammation can damage tissue and interfere with blood flow. When blood flow is interrupted, blood pressure can drop dangerously low. This stops oxygen from reaching the organs and tissues."
What are the sources of infection for sepsis?,Sepsis can be triggered by an infection in any part of the body. The most common sites of infection that lead to sepsis are the: lungs - urinary tract - tummy (abdomen) -pelvis
What tests are used to diagnose sepsis?,"Sepsis is often diagnosed by testing ( temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, blood ) Other tests can help determine the type of infection, where it's located and which parts of the body have been affected."
Who is at risk of sepsis?,"Anyone can develop sepsis after an injury or minor infection. However, some people are more vulnerable."
How do you recover from sepsis?,Some people make a full recovery from sepsis fairly quickly. The amount of time it takes to fully recover from sepsis varies depending on: the severity of the sepsis - the person's overall health - how much time was spent in hospital - whether treatment was needed in an intensive care unit (ICU)
What are the long-term effects of sepsis?,Some people with sepsis will experience long-term physical and psychological problems. This is known as post-sepsis syndrome.
what is bone cancer?,"Primary bone cancer is a rare type of cancer that begins in the bones. This is a separate condition from secondary bone cancer, which is cancer that spreads to the bones after developing in another part of the body."
What are the signs and symptoms of bone cancer?,"Bone cancer can affect any bone, but most cases develop in the long bones of the legs or upper arms."
What are the types of bone cancer?,Some of the main types of bone cancer are: osteosarcoma - Ewing sarcoma - chondrosarcoma
What causes bone cancer?,"In most cases, it's not known why a person develops bone cancer."
How is bone cancer treated?,Treatment for bone cancer depends on the type of bone cancer you have and how far it has spread.
what is the introduction of Bone cancer for Teenagers and young adults?,"If you're looking for information about bone cancer in people of all ages, read our general bone cancer section."
What are the types of bone cancer?,There are different types of bone cancer. The 2 most common bone cancers to affect teenagers are osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma.
What causes bone cancer in teenagers and young adults?,"The cause of bone cancer is unknown. Because it’s more common in young people, doctors think that it may be linked to the changes that happen when bones are growing. There is lots of ongoing research into the possible causes."
What are the signs and symptoms of bone cancer?,"Bone cancer symptoms vary, and not everyone will feel the same. Many symptoms are similar to everyday aches and pains, so they can be mistaken for other things, like strains, sports injuries or growing pains."
what about bowel cancer ?,"Bowel cancer is a general term for cancer that begins in the large bowel. Depending on where the cancer starts, bowel cancer is sometimes called colon or rectal cancer."
What are the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer?,"The 3 main symptoms of bowel cancer are blood in the stools (faeces), changes in bowel habit – such as more frequent, looser stools – and abdominal (tummy) pain. However, these symptoms are very common and most people with them do not have bowel cancer. For example, blood in the stools is more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles), and a change in bowel habit or abdominal pain is usually the result of something you have eaten."
When should I seek medical advice for bowel cancer?,Your doctor will probably carry out a simple examination of your tummy and bottom to make sure you have no lumps. They may also arrange for a simple blood test to check for iron deficiency anaemia. This can indicate whether there is any bleeding from your bowel that you haven't been aware of.
Who is at risk of bowel cancer?,"It's not known exactly what causes bowel cancer, but there are a number of things that can increase your risk."
What is bowel cancer screening?,Bowel screening is offered to men and women aged 50 to 74 across Scotland to help find bowel cancer early when it can often be cured.
How is bowel cancer treated?,"Bowel cancer can be treated using a combination of different treatments, depending on where the cancer is in your bowel and how far it has spread."
what about bowel incontinence?,"Bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It's also sometimes known as faecal incontinence."

When should I seek advice and treatment for bowel incontinence?,"Bowel incontinence can be upsetting and hard to cope with, but treatment is effective and a cure is often possible, so make sure you see your GP."
How is bowel incontinence treated?,"In many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life."
what is bowel polyps?,"Bowel polyps are small growths on the inner lining of the colon (large bowel) or rectum. They are common, affecting 15-20% of the UK population, and don't usually cause symptoms."
How are bowel polyps caused?,"Bowel polyps are caused by an abnormal production of cells. The lining of the bowel constantly renews itself, and a faulty gene can cause the cells in the bowel lining to grow more quickly."
What are the symptoms of bowel polyps?,Most people with polyps won't be aware of them as they produce no symptoms and are often discovered by accident.
How are bowel polyps discovered?,"Bowel polyps are usually found as a result of a bowel investigation for another reason, such as a sigmoidoscopy (examination of the last part of the bowel) or during screening for bowel cancer."
How are bowel polyps treated?,"There are several methods for treating polyps, but the most common procedure involves snaring the polyp during a colonoscopy. Snaring is like cutting the polyp off with cheese wire and is painless."
what is brain stem death?,"Brain stem death is when a person no longer has any brain stem functions, and has permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe."
What is involved in confirming death due to brain stem death?,"Confirming death used to be straightforward. Death was said to occur when the heart stopped beating and a person was unresponsive and no longer breathing. The lack of oxygen, which occurred as a result of no blood flow, quickly led to the permanent loss of brain stem function."
What is the role of the brain stem?,The brain stem is the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord (part of the central nervous system in the spinal column).
How does brain death occur?,Brain death can occur when the blood and/or oxygen supply to the brain is stopped. This can be caused by: cardiac arrest - heart attack - stroke - blood clot
What is the vegetative state?,"There's a difference between brain death and a vegetative state, which can occur after extensive brain damage. Someone in a vegetative state can show signs of wakefulness – for example, they may open their eyes, but not respond to their surroundings."
How is brain death confirmed?,"Although rare, a few things can make it appear as though someone is brain dead."
what about brain tumors?,"A brain tumour is a growth of cells in the brain that multiplies in an abnormal, uncontrollable way. It can either be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign)."
What are the symptoms of a brain tumor?,"The symptoms of a brain tumour vary depending on the exact part of the brain that's affected. Sometimes, you may not have any symptoms to begin with, or they may only develop very slowly over time."
When should I speak to my doctor about brain tumors?,"Speak to your GP if you have persistent symptoms of a brain tumour. While it's unlikely to be a tumour, it's best to be sure by getting a proper diagnosis."
Who is affected by brain tumors?,"Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults."
How are brain tumors treated?,"The main treatment for most brain tumours is surgery, which aims to remove as much of the abnormal tissue as possible."
what is the introduction of Brain tumors for Children?,Brain tumours are the most common tumours that develop in children. Children of any age may be affected. Boys are affected slightly more often than girls.
what is Brain tumours?,"A tumour in the brain can come from the brain itself (primary), or from another part of the body (secondary). This information is about primary brain tumours."
What are the signs and symptoms of brain tumors in children?,"Symptoms will depend on the size of the tumour, where it is and how it affects that part of the brain. Symptoms are caused by the pressure inside the head being higher than it should be. A growing tumour may push normal brain out of the way, or block the flow of fluid in the brain."
what is The brain?,"The brain is contained within the skull, which protects it. Between the brain and the skull, there are 3 layers of membrane called the meninges. These completely cover the brain and spinal cord and help to protect it. Between 2 of these layers is a space that contains a fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which circulates around the brain and spinal cord."
What happens when a brain tumor is suspected in children?,Knowing what a test involves can make things a bit easier. The specialist doctor and nurse will explain things but don’t be afraid to ask questions.
What are the types of brain tumors?,"There are different types of brain tumours and they are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. The main types are astrocytoma, ependymoma, and medulloblastoma, but there are many other, less common types."
How are brain tumors treated in children?,"Because there are different types of brain tumours, treatment will not be the same for everyone. The doctors will look at the type of brain tumour, its size and where it is in the brain before deciding on the best treatment."
What are your feelings about brain tumors in children?,"As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support."
What is the relationship between the brain and brain tumors?,Any illness to do with your brain can be scary. Understanding a bit more about how the brain works might help.
what is the brain?,"The brain and the spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS). The brain is the ‘control centre’ which coordinates most body functions. It is inside the skull, which protects it. The spinal cord is made up of nerves that run down the spine. It passes messages between the brain and the rest of the body."
What are the different types of brain tumors?,There are different types of brain tumour. They are usually named after the type of cells they develop from. Brain tumours can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). This information is about both types.
what about breast cancer in females?,"Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also get breast cancer. If it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body."
What are the breasts?,"The breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed."
What are the symptoms of breast cancer?,"Breast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue."
What are the types of breast cancer?,"There are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types."
How is breast cancer screened?,"There's a good chance of recovery if breast cancer is detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP."
How is breast cancer treated?,"If cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body. Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments."
How can breast cancer be prevented?,"As the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether. If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk."
How do people live with breast cancer?,"Being diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways, depending on what stage it's at and what treatment you're having."
what about breast cancer in men?,"Breast cancer is often thought of as a condition that only affects women, but men can also develop it. It's much less common in men than women."
When should I speak to my doctor about breast cancer in men?,"You should always talk to your GP if you notice a lump in your breast or you have problems affecting your nipples, such as discharge. While these symptoms are unlikely to be caused by breast cancer, they should be investigated further."
Why does breast cancer happen in men?,"The cause of male breast cancer is unclear, but factors known to increase your chances of developing the condition include: age - having a family history of breast cancer (male or female) - obesity"
How is breast cancer treated in men?,"In most cases, surgery is used to remove the cancer, along with a section of the breast. This may be followed by a long-term course of hormone-blocking therapy using medication, usually a drug called tamoxifen."
How can I reduce my risk of breast cancer as a man?,"The most effective way of reducing your risk of developing breast cancer, as well as other serious health conditions, is to: drink alcohol in moderation - maintain a healthy weight - exercising regularly"
what is bronchiectasis?,"Bronchiectasis is a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection."
When should I see my doctor about bronchiectasis?,"You should see your GP if you develop a persistent cough. While this may not be caused by bronchiectasis, it requires further investigation."
How does bronchiectasis affect the lungs?,"The lungs are full of tiny branching airways, known as bronchi. Oxygen travels through these airways, ends up in tiny sacs called alveoli, and from there is absorbed into the bloodstream."
Why does bronchiectasis happen?,Bronchiectasis can develop if the tissue and muscles that surround the bronchi are damaged or destroyed.
Who is affected by bronchiectasis?,"It can affect anyone at any age, but symptoms don't usually develop until middle age. Over 12,000 people were admitted to hospital in England during 2013-14 with bronchiectasis. The majority of these people were over 60 years old."
How is bronchiectasis treated?,"The damage caused to the lungs by bronchiectasis is permanent, but treatment can help relieve your symptoms and stop the damage getting worse."
What are the possible complications of bronchiectasis?,"Complications of bronchiectasis are rare, but they can be serious. One of the most serious complications is coughing up large amounts of blood, caused by one of the blood vessels in the lungs splitting. This problem can be life-threatening and may require emergency surgery to treat it."
what is bronchitis?,"Bronchitis is an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed."
When should I see my doctor about bronchitis?,"Most cases of bronchitis can be treated easily at home with rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and plenty of fluids."
How is bronchitis treated?,"In most cases, bronchitis will clear up by itself within a few weeks without the need for treatment. This type of bronchitis is known as ""acute bronchitis"". While you are waiting for it to pass, you should drink lots of fluid and get plenty of rest."
Why do I have bronchitis?,"The bronchi are the main airways in your lungs, which branch off on either side of your windpipe (trachea). They lead to smaller and smaller airways inside your lungs, known as bronchioles."
What are the complications of bronchitis?,"Pneumonia is the most common complication of bronchitis. It happens when the infection spreads further into the lungs, causing air sacs inside the lungs to fill up with fluid. 1 in 20 cases of bronchitis leads to pneumonia. Mild pneumonia can usually be treated with antibiotics at home. More severe cases may require admission to hospital."
Who is affected by bronchitis?,"Acute bronchitis is one of the most common types of lung infection, and is one of the top five reasons for GP visits. Acute bronchitis can affect people of all ages, but is most common in younger children under the age of five. It is more common in winter, and often develops following a cold, sore throat or flu."
what is the introduction of bulimia?,Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder and mental health condition. People with bulimia are very anxious about their weight and focused on having the ‘right’ body shape. They also spend a lot of time thinking about food.
How common is bulimia?,"It’s estimated that bulimia affects around 1.5% of women and 0.5% of men across the course of a lifetime. It’s unusual for bulimia symptoms to develop before puberty, and the most common time for the condition to develop is the teenage years."
How is bulimia treated?,"Bulimia can be treated using a number of different talking therapies, including guided self-help and cognitive behavioural therapy for eating disorders (CBT-ED)."
what is bunions?,A bunion (hallux valgus) is a deformity caused by the base joint of the big toe developing sideways. This pushes the bones of the big toe towards the smaller toes.
What causes a bunion?,Bunions can be caused by: a genetic (hereditary) tendency to have a weakness of this joint  a joint problem such as osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis

How is a bunion diagnosed?,"To diagnose a bunion, a healthcare professional will ask you about it and examine your big toe. Other investigations may be considered, these can be discussed with your healthcare professional."
How are bunions treated?,Wearing the right footwear is one of the best things you can do to help. Choose flat wide shoes that fit you properly. Ones with laces or an adjustable strap are best as they can adjust to the width of your foot.
what about carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid tumors?,"A carcinoid tumour is a rare cancer of the neuroendocrine system – the body system that produces hormones. The tumour usually grows in the bowels or appendix, but it can also be found in the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, kidney, ovaries or testicles. It tends to grow very slowly."
What are the symptoms caused by the tumor?,"Some tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance. For example, an appendix carcinoid tumour may only be found when the appendix is being removed for another reason."
What are the symptoms caused by the hormones?,"Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:  diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite - flushing of the skin, particularly the face - fast heart rate - breathlessness and wheezing"
What causes carcinoid tumors?,"It's not known exactly why carcinoid tumours develop, but it's thought that most occur by chance."
How are carcinoid tumors diagnosed?,"A carcinoid tumour may be found incidentally – for example, as a surgeon is removing an appendix. In this case, the tumour will often be caught early and removed along with the appendix, causing no further problems."
How are carcinoid tumors and carcinoid syndrome treated?,"If the tumour is caught early, it may be possible to completely remove it and cure the cancer altogether. Otherwise, surgeons will remove as much of the tumour as possible (debulking)."
What can I do to help myself with carcinoid tumors?,"There are things you can do yourself to manage some of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Generally, you should avoid triggers of flushing, such as: alcohol - large meals - spicy foods - foods containing the substance tyramine, such as aged cheese and salted or pickled meats - stress"

What is the outlook for cellulitis?,"Cellulitis can usually be treated successfully with antibiotics, and most people make a full recovery."
What are the causes of cellulitis?,"Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria that cause it often live harmlessly on the skin, but they can lead to an infection if they get into a break in your skin (a bruise, cut or graze , an animal bite or insect bite, a leg ulcer, dry, cracked skin )"
How can cellulitis be prevented?,"If you've had cellulitis before, you're more likely to get it again."
what is cervical cancer?,"Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that develops in a woman's cervix (the entrance to the womb from the vagina). Cancer of the cervix often has no symptoms in its early stages. If you do have symptoms, the most common is unusual vaginal bleeding, which can occur after sex, in between periods or after the menopause."
What is the screening process for cervical cancer?,"Cervical screening (also known as a smear test) is routinely offered to anyone with a cervix in Scotland, between the ages of 25 and 64, every 5 years. You may be recalled more often depending on your test results."
What causes cervical cancer?,Almost all cases of cervical cancer are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV is a very common virus that can be passed on through any type of sexual contact with a man or a woman.
How is cervical cancer treated?,"If cervical cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it's usually possible to treat it using surgery. In some cases, it's possible to leave the womb in place, but it may need to be removed. The surgical procedure used to remove the womb is called a hysterectomy."
What are the complications of cervical cancer?,"Many women with cervical cancer will have complications. These can arise as a direct result of the cancer or as a side effect of treatments such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery."
Who is affected by cervical cancer?,"It's possible for women of all ages to develop cervical cancer, but the condition mainly affects sexually active women aged between 30 and 45. Cervical cancer is very rare in women under 25."

When should I see a doctor about chickenpox?,"For most children, chickenpox is a mild illness that gets better on its own.However, some children can become more seriously ill with chickenpox and need to see a doctor."
How does chickenpox affect adults?,"Chickenpox may be a childhood illness, but adults can get it too. Chickenpox tends to be more severe in adults than children, and adults have a higher risk of developing complications."
Who is at special risk for chickenpox?,Some children and adults are at special risk of serious problems if they catch chickenpox.
What are the implications of chickenpox in pregnancy?,"Chickenpox occurs in approximately 3 in every 1,000 pregnancies. It can cause serious complications for both the pregnant woman and her baby. See complications of chickenpox for further information on what to do if you are exposed to chickenpox during pregnancy."
What is the connection between chickenpox and shingles?,"Once you have had chickenpox, you usually develop antibodies to the infection and become immune to catching it again. However, the virus that causes chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus, remains inactive (dormant) in your body's nerve tissues and can return later in life as an illness called shingles."
Is there a vaccine available for chickenpox?,"There is a chickenpox vaccine, but it is not part of the routine childhood vaccination schedule. The vaccine is only offered to children and adults who are particularly vulnerable to chickenpox complications."
what is chilblains?,"Chilblains are small, itchy swellings on the skin that occur as a reaction to cold temperatures. They most often affect the body's extremities, such as the toes, fingers, heels, ears and nose."
What are the signs and symptoms of chilblains?,"Chilblains usually develop several hours after exposure to the cold. They typically cause a burning and itching sensation in the affected areas, which can become more intense if you go into a warm room."
When should I seek medical advice for chilblains?,Most people don't need to seek medical advice if they have chilblains as they usually heal within a few weeks and don't cause any permanent problems.
What causes chilblains?,"Some people develop chilblains that last for several months every winter. When the skin is cold, blood vessels near its surface get narrower. If the skin is then exposed to heat, the blood vessels become wider."
Who is more at risk for chilblains?,"People who smoke are more at risk of chilblains as nicotine constricts blood vessels. Chilblains can also occur on areas of the feet exposed to pressure, such as a bunion or a toe that's squeezed by tight shoes."
How are chilblains treated?,"Chilblains often get better on their own after a week or two without treatment. It may help to use a soothing lotion, such as calamine or witch hazel, to relieve itching. Your pharmacist may also be able to recommend a suitable product."
How can chilblains be prevented?,"If your skin gets cold, it's important to warm it up gradually. Heating the skin too quickly – for example, by placing your feet in hot water or near a heater – is one of the main causes of chilblains."
What are the complications of chilblains?,"if you have severe or recurring chilblains, there's a small risk of further problems developing, such as: infection from blistered or scratched skin - ulcers forming on the skin - permanent discolouration of the skin - scarring of the skin"
How can complications of chilblains be avoided?,You can also help reduce your risk of infection by cleaning any breaks in your skin with antiseptic and covering the area with an antiseptic dressing. The dressing should be changed every other day until the skin heals.
How do you get chlamydia?,Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a long term (chronic) neurological condition that affects the nervous and immune systems.
What are the symptoms of chlamydia?,"The symptoms of the condition vary from person to person. There may be times when your symptoms improve and you'll be able to do some normal everyday activities. At other times, symptoms may get worse, affecting your daily life."
How is chlamydia tested?,"Further research is needed to confirm what causes ME/CFS. There might be various factors involved and there may be a number of different types of the illness. These different sub-groups still need more research to be identified, including how they lead to different experiences of the condition and how it develops."
How is chlamydia treated?,"There's no single test to detect ME/CFS. A diagnosis is made after other possible known causes for symptoms have been excluded. The earlier the illness is recognised, the sooner you can get help to manage your symptoms. Many people with ME/CFS find it helps to keep a diary of their symptoms so that they can take this to their GP or specialist."
How can I avoid passing on chlamydia to a partner?,"Although there's no cure for ME/CFS, there are ways to help manage your symptoms. Because of the complexity of the illness different things work for different people. Your GP may be able to support you through managing your individual symptoms."
How can the risk of chlamydia be reduced?,There are some things that you can do for yourself to help you manage the condition. Small changes make a difference to your energy and mobility. This is called self-management.
what is Myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome?,Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively.
What are the symptoms of Myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome?,"The main symptoms of advanced kidney disease include : tiredness - swollen ankles, feet or hands (due to water retention) - shortness of breath - nausea - blood in the urine"
What causes Myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome?,"Chronic kidney disease is most frequently diagnosed through blood and urine tests. If you're at a high risk of developing CKD, you may be screened annually. Screening may be recommended if you have: high blood pressure (hypertension) - diabetes -a family history of CKD"
How is Myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosed?,"The kidneys are 2 bean-shaped organs, the size of your fist. They're located on either side of the body, just beneath the ribcage. The main role of the kidneys is to filter waste products from the blood before converting them into urine."
How is Myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome treated?,"CKD is common and mainly associated with ageing. The older you get, the more likely you are to have some degree of kidney disease. It's estimated that about 1 in 5 men and 1 in 4 women between the ages of 65 and 74 has some degree of CKD."
How can individuals live with Myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome?,"There is no cure for chronic kidney disease, although treatment can slow or halt the progression of the disease and can prevent other serious conditions developing."
what is chronic kidney disease?,"Being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease can be worrying, but support and advice are available to help you cope."
What are the symptoms of advanced kidney disease?,"The main way to reduce the chances of CKD developing is to ensure any existing conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, are carefully managed."
How is chronic kidney disease diagnosed?,Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells and tends to progress slowly over many years.
Why does chronic kidney disease happen?,CLL doesn't usually cause any symptoms early on and may only be picked up during a blood test carried out for another reason.
Who is affected by chronic kidney disease?,"As CLL progresses slowly and often has no symptoms at first, you may not need to be treated immediately. If it's caught early on, you'll have regular check-ups over the following months or years to see if it's getting any worse."
How is chronic kidney disease treated?,"The outlook for CLL depends on how advanced it is when it's diagnosed, how old you are when diagnosed, and your general health."
What is it like to live with chronic kidney disease?,"It's not clear what causes CLL. There's no proven link with radiation or chemical exposure, diet or infections. You can't catch it from anyone else or pass it on."
Can chronic kidney disease be prevented?,Leukaemia is cancer of the white blood cells. Chronic leukaemia means the condition progresses slowly over many years. Chronic leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected by cancer.
what about chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,"In leukaemia, a genetic mutation in the stem cells causes a huge over-production of white blood cells and a corresponding drop in red blood cells and platelets. It's this lack of red blood cells which causes symptoms of anaemia, such as tiredness, and the lack of platelets that increases the risk of excessive bleeding."
What are the symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,"In its early stages, chronic myeloid leukaemia usually causes no noticeable symptoms. As the condition develops, symptoms include: tiredness - weight loss - night sweats - a feeling of bloating - bruising - bone pain"
What are the treatments available for chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,"Chronic myeloid leukaemia is quite a rare type of cancer. Chronic myeloid leukaemia can affect people of any age, but it is more common in people aged 40 to 60. There is no evidence that it runs in families."
What is the outlook for chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases including chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic obstructive airways disease."
What are the causes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,"The main cause of COPD is smoking. The likelihood of developing COPD increases the more you smoke and the longer you've been smoking. This is because smoking irritates and inflames the lungs, which results in scarring."
what is chronic myeloid leukemia?,"COPD is one of the most common respiratory diseases in the UK. It usually only starts to affect people over the age of 35, although most people are not diagnosed until they are in their 50s."
What happens in chronic leukemia?,It is important that COPD is diagnosed as early as possible so treatment can be used to try to slow down the deterioration of your lungs. You should see your GP if you have any of the symptoms of COPD.
What are the warning signs of chronic myeloid leukemia?,"Although the damage that has already occurred to your lungs cannot be reversed, you can slow down the progression of the disease. Stopping smoking is particularly effective at doing this."
How common is chronic myeloid leukemia?,"COPD can affect your life in many ways, but help is available to reduce its impact. Simple steps such as living in a healthy way, being as active as possible, learning breathing techniques, and taking your medication can help you to reduce the symptoms of COPD."
what is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"Although COPD causes about 25,000 deaths a year in the UK, severe COPD can usually be prevented by making changes to your lifestyle. If you smoke, stopping is the single most effective way to reduce your risk of getting the condition."
Why does chronic obstructive pulmonary disease happen?,Chronic or persistent pain is pain that carries on for longer than 12 weeks despite medication or treatment. Most people get back to normal after pain following an injury or operation. But sometimes the pain carries on for longer or comes on without any history of an injury or operation.
Who is affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,The brain and the nerves inside the spine (the spinal nerves) make up the central nervous system. The spinal nerves carry messages from the body to the brain to tell it what's going on.
How is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosed?,It isn't possible to tell in advance whose pain will become chronic. But we know that people are more likely to develop chronic pain during or after times of stress or unhappiness.
How is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated?,"There’s a lot you can do to help yourself and have a better life even with chronic pain. Simple changes can often make a big difference to the amount of disability and suffering you can experience. This is called pain management.  To help manage your pain, you might consider:  Planning your day - Make a plan of things to do and places to be to help you keep on top of your pain."
What is it like to live with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease?,"When the body feels under threat it produces stress hormones that make us feel anxious and tense. The body sees pain as a threat and when it's persistent or chronic, it can make us feel unwell."
Can chronic obstructive pulmonary disease be prevented?,"If you're still in pain after 12 weeks, speak to your GP if you haven't already done so. Your GP will be able to tell you the best plan for managing your pain."
what is chronic pain?,There are a range of organisations that support people with pain by providing resources to help you self-manage you long term pain condition. These include:
What is pain?,Chronic pancreatitis is a condition where the pancreas (a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage) becomes permanently damaged from inflammation.
How common is chronic pain?,Always visit your GP if you're experiencing severe pain – it's a warning sign that something is wrong.
What can I do for myself regarding chronic pain?,"Long-term alcohol misuse is responsible for around 7 out of every 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. This is because heavy drinking over a number of years can repeatedly damage the pancreas. Less common causes include: smoking - a problem with the immune system, causing it to attack the pancreas - an inherited genetic mutation disrupting the functions of the pancreas"
How can I deal with the stress and depression associated with chronic pain?,"Chronic pancreatitis can affect people of any age, but is most common in middle-aged men aged between 45 and 54."
When should I see my doctor about chronic pain?,"In most cases of chronic pancreatitis, there's no specific treatment to reduce the inflammation and repair the damage to the pancreas."
Where can I find further information about chronic pain?,"Living with chronic pain can cause mental as well as physical strain. It's important to speak to your GP if you're experiencing stress, anxiety or depression caused by chronic pancreatitis."
what is chronic pancreatitis?,"Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver caused by continuous, long-term liver damage. Scar tissue replaces healthy tissue in the liver and prevents the liver from working properly."
When should I seek medical advice about chronic pancreatitis?,"There are usually few symptoms in the early stages of cirrhosis. However, as your liver loses its ability to function properly, you're likely to experience a loss of appetite, nausea and itchy skin."
Why does chronic pancreatitis happen?,"As cirrhosis doesn't have many obvious symptoms during the early stages, it's often picked up during tests for an unrelated illness."
Who is affected by chronic pancreatitis?,The most common causes of cirrhosis are:  drinking too much alcohol (alcohol misuse) over many years  being infected with the hepatitis C virus for a long time  a condition called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that causes excess fat to build up in the liver
How is chronic pancreatitis treated?,"There's currently no cure for cirrhosis. However, it's possible to manage the symptoms and any complications, and slow its progression."
What are the complications of chronic pancreatitis?,Not exceeding the recommended limits for alcohol consumption is the best way of preventing alcohol-related cirrhosis.
what about cirrhosis?,"Clostridium difficile, also known as C. difficile or C. diff, is a bacterium that can infect the bowel and cause diarrhoea. The infection most commonly affects people who have recently been treated with antibiotics, but can spread easily to others."
What are the signs and symptoms of cirrhosis?,"Symptoms of a C. difficile infection usually develop when you're taking antibiotics, or when you've finished taking them within the last few weeks."
When should I see my doctor for cirrhosis?,"Many C. difficile infections used to occur in places where many people take antibiotics and are in close contact with each other, such as hospitals and care homes."
What causes cirrhosis?,"Visiting your GP surgery with a possible C. difficile infection can put others at risk, so it's best to phone your GP or NHS 111 if you're concerned or feel you need advice."
How is cirrhosis treated?,"Your GP will decide whether you need hospital treatment (if you're not already in hospital). If the infection is relatively mild, you may be treated at home."
Can cirrhosis be prevented?,"If you're well enough to be treated at home, the following measures can help relieve your symptoms and prevent the infection spreading."
what is Clostridium difficile?,C. difficile bacteria are found in the digestive system of about 1 in every 30 healthy adults. The bacteria often live harmlessly because the other bacteria normally found in the bowel keep it under control.
What are the symptoms of a Clostridium difficile infection?,"C. difficile infections can be passed on very easily. You can reduce your risk of picking it up or spreading it by practising good hygiene, both at home and in healthcare settings."
Who is most at risk of Clostridium difficile?,Coeliac disease is a common autoimmune condition where the immune system in a person’s intestine (gut) reacts when they eat gluten. This causes chronic inflammation.
When should I seek medical advice about Clostridium difficile?,"Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye."
What are the treatment options for Clostridium difficile?,Coeliac disease affects 1 person in every 100. Only about one third of them are ever diagnosed. Coeliac disease can be diagnosed at any age.
How can I look after myself at home if I have Clostridium difficile?,"Coeliac disease can cause a wide range of symptoms in the digestive system and rest of the body. Symptoms can develop at any age, but coeliac disease is most commonly diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 60 years."
How do you get Clostridium difficile?,Coeliac disease is more common in people with certain conditions and in relatives of people with coeliac disease. It's unknown exactly why people develop the condition.
How can I prevent the spread of Clostridium difficile?,"Most people with coeliac disease have antibodies in their blood. The first stage in diagnosis is a simple blood test. The second stage might result in a biopsy, if necessary."
what about coeliac disease?,"Coeliac disease can be effectively treated with a gluten-free diet. By adopting a gluten-free diet and lifestyle, you can manage your condition and improve your quality of life."
What is gluten?,"If coeliac disease isn't treated, you're at greater risk of conditions like osteoporosis and cancer in later life."
How many people have coeliac disease?,"Living with coeliac disease can be challenging but with the right support and information, it's completely manageable."
What are the symptoms of coeliac disease?,Cold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They're caused by the herpes simplex virus and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days.
What causes coeliac disease?,Cold sores aren't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required.
How is coeliac disease diagnosed?,"The strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as HSV-1. In rare cases, cold sores can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can be the result of having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes."
What are the treatment options for coeliac disease?,"The herpes simplex virus – or ""cold sore virus"" – is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time."
Are there any complications associated with coeliac disease?,"Cold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days. However, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time."
How can someone live well with coeliac disease?,"Cold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications."
what is cold sores?,"It's not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection."
When should I seek professional advice about cold sores?,"Someone who is in a coma is unconscious and has minimal brain activity. They're alive, but can't be woken up and show no signs of being aware. The person's eyes will be closed and they'll appear to be unresponsive to their environment. They won't normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily."
What causes cold sores?,Doctors assess a person's level of consciousness using a tool called the Glasgow Coma Scale. This level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration.
What is the herpes simplex virus?,"The experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. Some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they were in a coma, while others don't."
How are cold sores treated?,"A coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state."
Are there any complications associated with cold sores?,"A cold is a mild viral infection of the nose, throat, sinuses and upper airways. It's very common and usually clears up on its own within a week or two."
How can I prevent the infection of cold sores?,"Many painkillers and decongestants are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They're generally safe for older children and adults to take, but might not be suitable for babies, young children, pregnant women, people with certain underlying health conditions, and those taking certain other medications. Speak to a pharmacist if you're unsure."
What is a coma?,"If you or your child has a cold, there's usually no need to see your GP as it should clear within a week or two. It might also be a good idea to get advice from a GP if you're concerned about your baby or an elderly person, or if you have a long-term illness such as a lung condition. You can also phone NHS 24's 111 service for advice."
How should I care for and monitor a person in a coma?,"In general, a person becomes contagious from a few days before their symptoms begin until all of their symptoms have gone. This means most people will be infectious for around two weeks."
What can I do as a visitor for a person in a coma?,"It's been suggested that vitamin C, zinc  and garlic supplements may help reduce your risk of getting a cold, but there's currently not enough strong evidence to support this."
What is the recovery process from a coma?,There are many different heart conditions and problems which are collectively called heart disease.
what is common cold?,The most common heart condition in Scotland is coronary heart disease. This is caused when the heart’s blood vessels - the coronary arteries - become narrowed or blocked and can’t supply enough blood to the heart.
What should I do about a common cold?,"Angina is a pain or discomfort in your chest, arm, neck, stomach or jaw that happens when the blood supply to your heart becomes restricted because of your arteries becoming narrowed. This clogging is called atheroma. Angina is a symptom of coronary heart disease, not an illness in itself."
When should I seek professional advice about a common cold?,"Unstable angina can be undiagnosed chest pain or a sudden worsening of existing angina. It happens when the blood supply to the heart is severely restricted and angina attacks occur more frequently, with less and less activity."
How do colds spread?,A heart attack - also known as myocardial infarction or MI - happens when the blood supply to part of your heart muscle becomes completely blocked. This is most commonly caused by a piece of fatty material breaking off and a blood clot forms within a coronary artery. This can cause damage to the part of your heart muscle which that particular coronary artery was supplying.
What can I do to stop a cold from spreading?,"If the heart’s pumping action can’t work effectively, your heart muscle can’t meet your body’s demand for blood and oxygen, and your body develops various different symptoms, like fatigue and shortness of breath. This is called heart failure because of the failure of your heart to work efficiently."
what about common heart conditions?,"The heart muscle has its own electrical system which helps to stimulate the heartbeat. If the electrical signals within your heart are interrupted or disturbed, your heart can beat too quickly (tachycardia), too slowly (bradycardia) and/or in an irregular way. This is called an arrhythmia."
What is coronary heart disease?,"The valves open and close to regulate the flow of blood through the heart. Problems with the valves can increase the workload of your heart and can put a strain on your heart muscle, leading to a range of symptoms"
What is angina?,"Another condition which can affect the heart is high blood pressure or hypertension. Although it’s not a disease in itself, hypertension can lead to an increased risk of developing serious conditions such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks and strokes."
What is unstable angina?,"Congenital heart conditions occur when there’s an abnormality or defect with the structure of the heart of a developing foetus while inside the mother’s womb. A baby may be born with only one defect or with several defects. Some types of congenital heart defects are life-threatening, either immediately to the newborn or over time."
What is a heart attack?,Inherited conditions can be passed on through families. They are sometimes called familial or genetic heart conditions.
What is heart failure?,Congenital heart disease is a general term used to refer to a series of birth defects that affect the heart.
What are arrhythmias?,There are over 30 different types of heart defect.The two main types of congenital heart disease are: cyanotic heart disease - acyanotic heart disease
What is valve disease?,"Congenital heart disease is the most common type of birth defect, with 1 in 180 babies being born with the condition. Some babies born with congenital heart disease will require immediate surgery after birth, while many others will probably require surgery or medication at some point during their childhood."
What is high blood pressure?,The outlook for congenital heart disease varies depending on the type and severity of the heart defect.
What are congenital heart conditions?,Conjunctivitis is a common condition that causes redness and inflammation of the thin layer of tissue that covers the front of the eye (the conjunctiva).
What are inherited heart conditions?,"The conjunctiva can become inflamed as a result of:  a bacterial or viral infection – this is known as infective conjunctivitis  an allergic reaction to a substance such as pollen or dust mites – this is known as allergic conjunctivitis  the eye coming into contact with things that can irritate the conjunctiva, such as shampoo or chlorinated water, or a loose eyelash rubbing against the eye – this is known as irritant conjunctivitis"
what is congenital heart disease?,"Treatment isn't usually needed for conjunctivitis, because the symptoms often clear up within a couple of weeks. If treatment is needed, the type of treatment will depend on the cause. In severe cases, antibiotic eye drops can be used to clear the infection."
What are the types of congenital heart disease?,"Public Health Scotland (PHS) advises that you don't need to stay away from work or school if you or your child has conjunctivitis, unless you (or they) are feeling particularly unwell."
How common is congenital heart disease?,Conjunctivitis can be a frustrating condition – particularly allergic conjunctivitis – but in most cases it doesn't pose a serious threat to health.

What causes constipation?,A cough is a reflex action to clear your airways of mucus and irritants such as dust or smoke. It's rarely a sign of anything serious. Most coughs clear up within 3 weeks and don't require any treatment.
Who is affected by constipation?,"In rare cases, a short-term cough may be the first sign of a health condition that causes a persistent cough."
When should I seek professional advice about constipation?,"In most cases, a doctor won't worry whether a cough is dry or chesty, but will need to know if you are producing much more or darker phlegm than usual."
How is constipation treated?,"Coughs in children often have similar causes to those mentioned above. For example, respiratory tract infections, asthma and GORD can all affect children."
What can be done to prevent constipation?,Treatment isn't always necessary for short-term coughs because it's likely to be a viral infection that will get better on its own within a few weeks.
Are there any complications associated with constipation?,"Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system. Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon)."
what is Coronavirus?,"The exact cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. However, research suggests a combination of factors may be responsible."
what is cough?,"There's currently no cure for Crohn's disease, so the aim of treatment is to stop the inflammatory process, relieve symptoms (induce and maintain remission) and avoid surgery wherever possible."
How are short-term coughs treated?,"Crohn's disease is a relatively uncommon condition. Crohn's disease can affect people of all ages, including children. However, most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30. A large number of cases also develop between the ages of 60 and 80."
What should I know about persistent coughs?,"Over time, inflammation can damage sections of the digestive system, resulting in complications such as narrowing of the intestine (stricture), or a channel developing between the end of the bowel and the skin near the anus or vagina (fistula). These problems usually require surgical treatment."
How are coughs in children managed?,"If you have Crohn's disease, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS)."
What are some common cough treatments?,"Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe (trachea), the airways to the lungs (the bronchi) and the voice box (larynx). Children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in."
what is Crohn's disease?,"Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus."
Why does Crohn's disease happen?,"Croup usually affects young children aged between six months and three years, with most cases occurring in one-year-olds. However, croup can sometimes develop in babies as young as three months, and older children up to 15 years of age. Adults can also get croup but this is rare."
What are the treatment options for Crohn's disease?,"Most cases of croup are mild and can be treated at home. Sitting your child upright and comforting them if they are distressed is important, because crying may make symptoms worse. Your child should also drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration."
Who is affected by Crohn's disease?,"Most cases of croup clear up within 48 hours. However, in some cases symptoms can last for up to two weeks.It is extremely rare for a child to die from croup."
What are the complications associated with Crohn's disease?,"Croup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent. Good hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces."
Can you provide more information about living with Crohn's disease?,"Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus."
what is croup?,"Symptoms of cystic fibrosis tend to start in early childhood, although they can sometimes develop very soon after birth, or may not be obvious until adulthood."
Why does croup happen?,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by a faulty gene that a child inherits from both of their parents. The faulty gene means that some cells struggle to move salt and water across the cell wall. This, along with recurrent infections, can result in a build-up of thick, sticky mucus in the body's tubes and passageways."
Who is affected by croup?,Most cases of cystic fibrosis are now detected soon after birth through the newborn blood spot test. This involves collecting a drop of blood from the baby's heel and testing it for abnormalities that could indicate cystic fibrosis.
How is croup treated?,"There's currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a number of treatments are available to help control the symptoms, prevent complications, and make the condition easier to live with."
Are there any complications associated with croup?,"Cystic fibrosis is a progressive condition, which means it tends to get worse over time. Eventually the condition can be fatal if it leads to a serious infection or the lungs stop working properly."
What can be done to prevent croup?,"Cystitis is inflammation of the bladder, usually caused by a bladder infection. It's a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly in women, and is usually more of a nuisance than a cause for serious concern. Mild cases will often get better by themselves within a few days."
what is cystic fibrosis?,"The main symptoms of cystitis include: pain, burning or stinging when you pee  needing to pee more often and urgently than normal  urine that's dark, cloudy or strong smelling  pain low down in your tummy  feeling generally unwell, achy, sick and tired"
What are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis?,"Speak to your pharmacist if you think you may have cystitis or symptoms of a urine infection. Women who have had cystitis before don't necessarily need to see their GP if the condition returns, as mild cases often get better without treatment. You can try the self-help measures listed below, or ask your pharmacist for advice."
What causes cystic fibrosis?,Most cases are thought to occur when bacteria that live harmlessly in the bowel or on the skin get into the bladder through the urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body).
Can you explain the screening and testing methods for cystic fibrosis?,"If you see your pharmacist with symptoms of cystitis you can be treated under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. If you are female and between the ages of 16 to 65 years with signs of a mild urine infection, the pharmacist may offer you a course of antibiotics to treat the infection where appropriate. These should start to have an effect within a day or two."
What are the available treatments for cystic fibrosis?,"If you get cystitis frequently, there are some things you can try that may stop it coming back. However, it's not clear how effective most of these measures are."

When should I seek professional advice for cystitis?,"There are many potential causes of deafblindness. Some babies are born deafblind, but in many cases the hearing and/or vision loss occurs later in life.  Causes of deafblindness include:  age-related hearing loss  genetic conditions, such as Usher syndrome  an infection picked up during pregnancy, such as rubella (German measles)  cerebral palsy – a problem with the brain and nervous system that mainly affects movement and co-ordination  eye problems associated with increasing age, such as cataracts"
What causes cystitis?,"A range of care and support services is available to help deafblind people. Each deafblind person will have a different level of hearing and sight loss, which means they'll have their own individual care needs."
How is cystitis treated?,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops within a deep vein in the body, usually in the leg. Blood clots that develop in a vein are also known as venous thrombosis."
Are there any preventive measures for cystitis?,"In some cases, there may be no symptoms of DVT. If symptoms do occur they can include:  pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf or thigh)  a heavy ache in the affected area  warm skin in the area of the clot  red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee"
What is deafblindness?,"This is a serious condition that occurs when a piece of blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream. This then blocks one of the blood vessels in the lungs, preventing blood from reaching them."
What are the signs of deafblindness?,"Anyone can develop DVT, but it becomes more common over the age of 40. The combined contraceptive pill and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) both contain the female hormone oestrogen, which causes the blood to clot more easily. If you're taking either of these, your risk of developing DVT is slightly increased."
When should I see a doctor regarding deafblindness?,"See your GP as soon as possible if you think you may have DVT – for example, if you have pain, swelling and a heavy ache in your leg. They'll ask you about your symptoms and medical history."
What causes deafblindness?,Treatment for DVT usually involves taking anticoagulant medicines. These reduce the blood's ability to clot and stop existing clots getting bigger.
How can individuals live with deafblindness?,"If you need to go into hospital for surgery, a member of your care team will assess your risk of developing a blood clot while you're there."
What is deep vein thrombosis?,"Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in. When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions."
What are the symptoms of deep vein thrombosis?,"Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in hot weather) and your diet can contribute to dehydration."
Can you explain pulmonary embolism?,"Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include: babies and infants - older people - athletes"
What causes deep vein thrombosis?,"If you're dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts."
How is deep vein thrombosis diagnosed?,"See your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated."

What causes dehydration?,"Dementia with Lewy bodies is caused by deposits of an abnormal protein called Lewy bodies inside brain cells. These deposits, which are also found in people with Parkinson’s disease, build up in areas of the brain responsible for things such as memory and muscle movement."
Who is at risk of dehydration?,"If you think you may have early symptoms of dementia, it's a good idea to see your GP. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment, and perhaps suggest that you go along with them."
What should I do if I am experiencing dehydration?,"There is no cure for dementia with Lewy bodies or any medication that will slow it down. However, a few different medicines can be effective in controlling some of the symptoms. In particular, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (used to treat Alzheimer's disease) have been shown to improve symptoms such as hallucinations and confusion in some people."
When should I see a doctor about dehydration?,"How quick dementia with Lewy bodies progresses varies from person to person. Home-based help will be needed, and some people will eventually need residential care in a nursing home."
What is dementia?,"A dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form inside the teeth, in the gums, or in the bone that holds the teeth in place. It’s caused by a bacterial infection."
What are the specific characteristics of dementia with Lewy bodies?,"Symptoms of an abscess in your tooth or gum may include: an intense, throbbing pain in the affected tooth or gum  that may come on suddenly and gets gradually worse  pain that spreads to your ear, jaw and neck on the same side as the affected tooth or gum  pain that's worse when lying down, which may disturb your sleep  redness and swelling in your face"

What causes dementia with Lewy bodies?,"While you're waiting to see a dentist, painkillers can help control your pain. Ibuprofen is the preferred painkiller for dental abscesses, but if you're unable to take it for medical reasons, you can take paracetamol instead. Aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16."
How is dementia with Lewy bodies diagnosed?,Dental abscesses are treated by removing the source of the infection and draining away the pus.
How is dementia with Lewy bodies managed?,"Your mouth is full of bacteria, which form a sticky film on your teeth called plaque. If you don't keep your teeth clean, acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can damage your teeth and gums, leading to tooth decay or gum disease."
What is the outlook for individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies?,You can reduce your risk of developing dental abscesses by keeping your teeth and gums as healthy as possible.
what about dental abscesses?,"Everyone has spells of feeling down, but depression is more than just spending a few days feeling sad or unhappy. Depression can make you feel persistently sad and down for weeks or months at a time."

You're also more likely to experience depression if you have a family history of depression. However, it's also possible to become depressed without there being an obvious reason."
How can I relieve my symptoms for a dental abscess?,Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is an autoimmune skin condition linked to coeliac disease.
What are the available treatments for a dental abscess?,"DH affects around 1 in 10,000 people. DH can appear at any age, but is most commonly diagnosed in those between the ages of 15 and 40. It's more common in men than women and is rare in children."
What causes dental abscesses?,"People with DH can have: red, raised patches often with blisters that burst with scratching and severe itching and often stinging"
Are there any preventive measures for dental abscesses?,"DH is caused by the body's immune system reacting to a protein called gluten in foods containing wheat, barley and rye. This reaction causes a skin rash to develop."
What is depression?,A diagnosis of DH is confirmed by a skin test called a skin biopsy. A skin biopsy is a procedure where a sample of skin is removed to be tested.
How can I determine if I have depression?,The treatment for DH is a lifelong gluten-free diet. A gluten-free diet is when all gluten-containing foods are removed from your diet
When should I see a doctor about depression?,Some patients will be given medication to help them over this period of recovery. Medication will only be given to control the skin itching and blisters and doesn't treat any other symptoms.
what is dermatitis herpetiformis?,DH can cause the same conditions and complications as coeliac disease.
How common is dermatitis herpetiformis?,"Diarrhoea is passing looser or more frequent stools than is normal for you. It affects most people from time to time and is usually nothing to worry about.

Are there any preventive measures for diarrhoea?,"1 in 4 people who develop diverticula will experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain. Having symptoms associated with diverticula is known as diverticular disease."
what is discoid eczema?,"Diverticulitis describes infection that occurs when bacteria becomes trapped inside one of the bulges, triggering more severe symptoms."
When should I seek medical advice for eczema?,"A high-fibre diet can often ease symptoms of diverticular disease, and paracetamol can be used to relieve pain – other painkillers such as aspirin or ibuprofen are not recommended for regular use, as they can cause stomach upsets. Speak to your GP if paracetamol alone is not working."
What causes discoid eczema?,"Diverticular disease is one of the most common digestive conditions. Both sexes are equally affected by diverticular disease and diverticulitis, although the condition is more likely to appear at a younger age (under 50) in men than in women. Overall, symptoms of diverticulitis are most likely to occur in people over 70 years old."

This is a medical emergency and requires treatment as soon as possible."
How does endometriosis affect fertility?,"In some cases of epilepsy a cause cannot be found. If there's an identifiable cause, it usually involves the brain being affected by a condition. The brain is a delicate mix of nerve cells, electrical impulses and chemicals, known as neurotransmitters. Any damage has the potential to disrupt the workings of the brain and cause seizures."
Are there additional sources of help and support for endometriosis?,"Epilepsy is usually difficult to diagnose quickly. In most cases, it cannot be confirmed until you have had more than one seizure. It can be difficult to diagnose because many other conditions, like fainting, migraines and panic attacks, can cause similar symptoms."
what is epilepsy?,"Most people with epilepsy can be successfully treated with anti-seizure medication (ASMs). ASMs do not cure epilepsy, but can prevent seizures from occurring."

They will assess your general state of health because the condition can be the first sign of more serious health conditions, such as heart disease (when the heart’s blood supply is blocked or interrupted)."
What are the causes of epilepsy?,"Erectile dysfunction can have a range of causes, both physical and psychological. Physical causes include: narrowing of the blood vessels going to the penis – commonly associated with high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol or diabetes - hormonal problems - surgery or injury"
How is epilepsy diagnosed?,"Although you may be embarrassed, it's important to get a diagnosis so that the cause can be identified. Your GP can usually diagnose erectile dysfunction. This will involve answering questions about your symptoms, as well as a physical examination and some simple tests."
How is epilepsy treated?,"Erectile dysfunction is primarily treated by tackling the cause of the problem, whether this is physical or psychological. The narrowing of the arteries (called atherosclerosis) is one of the most common causes of ED. In these cases your GP may suggest lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, to try to reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease. This may help to relieve your symptoms as well as improving your general health."
How can someone live with epilepsy?,"Escherichia coli O157, sometimes called VTEC, is a bacterial infection. It can cause severe stomach pain, bloody diarrhoea and kidney failure."
What is sudden unexpected death in epilepsy?,"Symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and occasionally fever. About half of people with the infection will have bloody diarrhoea.  People usually notice symptoms 3 to 4 days after they have been infected. But symptoms can start any time between 1 and 14 days afterwards."
what is erectile dysfunction?,There is no specific treatment for E. coli O157 infection. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment.
When should I see my doctor about erectile dysfunction?,Anyone who has had an E. coli O157 infection should stay away from work or school until they have been completely free of symptoms for 48 hours.
Why does erectile dysfunction happen?,"Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of bone cancer.The 3 main types of primary bone cancer are chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Ewing sarcoma most commonly affects people who are 10 to 20 years old."
How is erectile dysfunction diagnosed?,A sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the body's supporting tissues. Bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas are the 2 main types. Ewing sarcoma usually occurs in bone. It most commonly develops in the pelvis bone (hips) or thigh bone (femur) or shin bone (tibia)
What are the treatment options for erectile dysfunction?,"The symptoms of Ewing sarcoma will depend on the size of the cancer and where it is in the body. The main symptoms are pain in the affected area that gets progressively worse, and swelling and tenderness."
what is Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157?,"Like other types of bone cancer, the exact cause of Ewing sarcoma is unknown. As the condition tends to predominantly affect older children and teenagers, one theory is that it may be related to fast-growing bones."
What are the symptoms of E. coli O157 infection?,"When you visit your GP because of bone pain, they'll ask you about your symptoms and examine the affected area."
How can E. coli O157 infection be treated and cared for at home?,"Like all types of cancer, the earlier Ewing sarcoma is diagnosed, the easier it is to treat. Ewing sarcoma is usually treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy."
What should I consider when returning to work or school after an E. coli O157 infection?,"If you're diagnosed with bone cancer, it can be upsetting and frightening. Knowing as much about the type of cancer you have and the best treatment options will help you make decisions. The majority of people who have surgery for bone cancer have a limb-sparing procedure."
what about Ewing sarcoma?,"Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer in children and young people. This information describes Ewing sarcoma, its symptoms, diagnosis and possible treatments."
What are sarcomas?,Sarcomas are rare types of cancer that develop in the supporting tissues of the body. There are 2 main types: bone sarcomas and soft tissue sarcomas.
What are the symptoms of Ewing sarcoma?,"Ewing sarcoma is the second most common primary sarcoma in children and young people. This type of cancer is a bone cancer and most commonly occurs in the long bones, ribs, pelvis and spine (vertebral column)."
What causes Ewing sarcoma?,"The exact causes of primary bone cancer are unknown. The development of Ewing sarcoma may be related in some way to times of rapid bone growth, which may explain why more cases are seen in teenagers. Like other cancers, it’s not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people."
How is Ewing sarcoma diagnosed?,"Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer. It is frequently worse at night. However, symptoms may vary depending on the position and size of the cancer. There may be some swelling in the affected area if the tumour is close to the surface of the body and it may become tender to touch. This may cause a limp if in the leg or pelvis. Bone cancer is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the child has a minor fall or accident. Occasionally, there may be fever or weight loss."
What are the treatment options for Ewing sarcoma?,"Usually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. If a sarcoma is suspected, your GP should refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre. A variety of tests and investigations are needed to diagnose Ewing sarcoma, including an X-ray of the painful part of the bone, a chest X-ray and a blood test. A specialist doctor will remove a small piece of the tumour to look at under a microscope (biopsy). Other tests may be done, such as a bone scan, PET scan, a bone marrow biopsy. An MRI or CT scan may also be done."
"How can someone live with bone cancer, specifically Ewing sarcoma?","A combination of various treatments is used to treat Ewing sarcoma. These include chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Treatment will depend on a number of factors, including the size and position of the tumour."
What is the introduction to Ewing sarcoma in children?,"There are a number of different types of cancer that affect the eyes, including (eye melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, retinoblastoma – a childhood cancer)"
What are sarcomas?,"Eye cancer doesn't always cause obvious symptoms and may only be picked up during a routine eye test. Symptoms of eye cancer can include: shadows, flashes of light, or wiggly lines in your vision  blurred vision  a dark patch in your eye that's getting bigger  partial or total loss of vision  bulging of one eye  a lump on your eyelid or in your eye that's increasing in size  pain in or around your eye, although this is rare"
What is Ewing sarcoma?,"Melanoma is cancer that develops from pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Most melanomas develop in the skin, but it's also possible for them to occur in other parts of the body, including the eye."
What are the causes of Ewing sarcoma?,Eye melanoma occurs when the pigment-producing cells in the eyes divide and multiply too rapidly. This produces a lump of tissue known as a tumour.
What are the signs and symptoms of Ewing sarcoma?,"If your GP or optician (optometrist) suspects you have a serious problem with your eyes, they will refer you to a specialist eye doctor called an ophthalmologist for an assessment."
How is Ewing sarcoma diagnosed?,"Treatment for melanoma of the eye depends on the size and location of the tumour. Your care team will explain each treatment option in detail, including the benefits and any potential complications."
What are the treatment options for Ewing sarcoma?,"A febrile seizure is a fit that can happen when a child has a fever. Febrile seizures are also sometimes called febrile convulsions. They are relatively common and, in most cases, aren't serious."
What is eye cancer?,"If your child is having a febrile seizure, place them in the recovery position. Lay them on their side, on a soft surface, with their face turned to one side. This will stop them swallowing any vomit, keep their airway open and help prevent injury."
What are the symptoms of eye cancer?,There are two main types of febrile seizure (Simple febrile seizure and Complex febrile seizure )
What is melanoma of the eye?,"The cause of febrile seizures is unknown, although they're linked to the start of a fever (a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above). In most cases, a high temperature is caused by an infection such as: chickenpox - flu (influenza) - middle ear infections (otitis media) - tonsillitis"
What causes eye melanoma?,"Febrile seizures have been linked to an increased risk of epilepsy, as well as other problems. Recent research findings may indicate a link between febrile seizures and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC), possibly due to the connection between febrile seizures and epilepsy."
How is melanoma of the eye diagnosed?,"Your normal body temperature is approximately 37°C. A fever is usually when your body temperature is 37.8°C or higher. You may feel warm, cold or shivery."
What are the treatments for eye melanoma?,"A fever is your body's natural response to many common illnesses such as: flu - tonsillitis - kidney or urinary tract infections (UTIs). Fever helps your body fight infections by stimulating your immune system (your body’s natural defence). By increasing your body’s temperature, a fever makes it harder for the bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive."
what is febrile seizure?,"Fever affects people of all ages, however it often affects babies and younger children in response to minor illnesses such as: coughs , colds"
What should be done during a febrile seizure?,"As a parent it can be extremely worrying if your child has a high temperature. However, it's very common and often clears up by itself without treatment. A quick and easy way to find out whether your child has a fever is to take their temperature using a thermometer."
What are the types of febrile seizure?,Most fevers are caused by infections or other illnesses. The high body temperature makes it more difficult for the bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive.
Why do febrile seizures occur?,"If your child has a fever, it's important to keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of cool water to drink. Babies should be given plenty of liquids, such as breast milk or formula. Even if your child isn't thirsty, try to get them to drink little and often to keep their fluid levels up."
What are the complications of febrile seizures?,"Sometimes a high temperature in children is associated with more serious signs and symptoms, such as:breathlessness, vomiting , rash, fits or seizures"
what is Fever in adults?,"Fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in the muscular wall of the womb (uterus). These growths are made up of muscle and tissue and can be different sizes. Some can be the size of a pea, others can be the size of a melon. They're sometimes known as uterine myomas or leiomyomas."
What causes a fever in adults?,Many people don't know that they have fibroids because they don't have any symptoms. This is nothing to worry about. You're worried about your symptoms or you regularly have: heavy periods - painful periods - tummy (abdominal) pain - lower back pain - a frequent need to urinate - constipation - pain or discomfort during sex - symptoms which are affecting your day to day life
How does fever manifest in children?,"The exact cause of fibroids is unknown. They’re linked to the hormones produced by the ovaries, oestrogen and progesterone. Fibroids usually develop and grow as long as the ovaries are producing these hormones. Fibroids may continue to grow during pregnancy. They tend to shrink when these hormone levels fall, such as after the menopause."
what about fever manifest in children?,"There are different types of fibroid. The main types of fibroids are: intramural, subserosal, submucosal, pedunculated"
What causes a high temperature in children?,"Fibroids will often shrink after the menopause, as hormone levels in your body change. If you have fibroids, but you're not affected by any symptoms then you don't need treatment."
How can a fever be treated?,"If you're having difficulty getting pregnant, your doctor or specialist may suggest extra support or treatments that can help. Your doctor will discuss these with you and you can ask any questions that you might have."
Are there more serious illnesses associated with fever?,"Fibromyalgia, also called fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), is a long-term condition that causes pain all over the body."
what is fibroids?,"The exact cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it's thought to be related to abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain and changes in the way the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord and nerves) processes pain messages carried around the body."
What are the symptoms of fibroids?,"Anyone can develop fibromyalgia, although it affects around seven times as many women as men. The condition typically develops between the ages of 30 and 50, but can occur in people of any age, including children and the elderly."
Why do fibroids develop?,"Although there's currently no cure for fibromyalgia, there are treatments to help relieve some of the symptoms and make the condition easier to live with."
What are the different types of fibroids?,Many people with fibromyalgia find that support groups provide an important network where they can talk to others living with the condition.
How are fibroids treated?,"Flatulence is passing gas from the digestive system out of the back passage. It's more commonly known as ""passing wind"", or ""farting"". Flatulence is a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about 5 to 15 times a day."
How do fibroids affect pregnancy?,"When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by farting (flatulence) or burping (belching)."
what about fibromyalgia?,There are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms.
What are the causes of fibromyalgia?,"Excessive flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as: avoiding foods known to cause flatulence  eating smaller and more frequent meals  eating and drinking slowly  exercising regularly"
Who is affected by fibromyalgia?,"Flu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes. It can be very unpleasant, but you'll usually begin to feel better within about a week."
What are the treatment options for fibromyalgia?,"Some of the main symptoms of flu include:  a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above  tiredness and weakness  a headache  general aches and pains  a dry, chesty cough"
Are there support groups available for fibromyalgia?,"If you're otherwise fit and healthy, there's usually no need to see your GP if you have flu-like symptoms. The best remedy is to rest at home, keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches if necessary."
what about flatulence?,"Consider visiting your GP if you're 65 years of age or over, you're pregnant, you have a long-term medical condition – such as diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease or a neurological disease, you have a weakened immune system – for example because you're having chemotherapy or have HIV, you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or start coughing up blood or your symptoms are getting worse over time or haven't improved after a week"
Why does flatulence occur?,"If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. You should begin to feel much better within a week or so, although you may feel tired for much longer."
When should I see a doctor for flatulence?,The flu virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes.
How can the problem of flatulence be controlled?,You can help stop yourself catching flu or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures. You can also help stop the spread of flu by avoiding unnecessary contact with other people while you're infectious. You should stay off work or school until you're feeling better.
what about the flu?,There's no known safe limit of drinking during pregnancy. Some people will tell you that having the odd drink when you’re pregnant is okay.
What are the symptoms of the flu?,"Your baby's developing all the way through your pregnancy. Alcohol can be harmful at any stage. Even small amounts of alcohol can cross over from your body into your baby. The exact level of alcohol exposure that can lead to harm is not known with certainty, but the more you drink, the greater the possible harm."
What should be done about the flu?,"For lots of women, stopping drinking when pregnant can be difficult - sometimes harder than they thought. The social pressure to have a drink can be huge and can make it harder to say no."
When should I see a doctor for the flu?,"Dads and partners can support a healthy, alcohol-free pregnancy by: not drinking alcohol around their partner  trying activities that don’t involve alcohol - you could go swimming or go for a walk  trying non-alcoholic alternatives such as mocktails, smoothies, and flavoured and fizzy water"
How long does the flu typically last and is it serious?,Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment.
How is the flu transmitted?,"The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food, although they may start at any point between a few hours and several weeks later."
What can be done to prevent the spread of the flu?,"Most people with food poisoning recover at home and don't need any specific treatment, although there are some situations where you should see your GP for advice (see below)."
what about Alcohol and pregnancy?,"You should contact your GP if: your symptoms are severe – for example, if you're unable to keep down any fluids because you are vomiting repeatedly, your symptoms don't start to improve after a few days, you have symptoms of severe dehydration, such as confusion, a rapid heartbeat, sunken eyes and passing little or no urine, you're pregnant, you're over 60, your baby or young child has suspected food poisoning"
How can alcohol harm a baby during pregnancy?,"Food can become contaminated at any stage during production, processing or cooking. For example, it can be contaminated by: not cooking food thoroughly (particularly meat), not correctly storing food that needs to be chilled at below 5C, leaving cooked food for too long at warm temperatures, not sufficiently reheating previously cooked food, someone who is ill or who has dirty hands touching the food, eating food that has passed its ""use by"" date, the spread of bacteria between contaminated foods (cross-contamination)"
What are the risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy?,Functional neurological disorder (FND) describes a problem with how the brain receives and sends information to the rest of the body.
How can I support my partner in avoiding alcohol during pregnancy?,"FND can have many symptoms that can vary from person to person. Some people may have few symptoms, and some people may have many."
what is food poisoning?,"There are other symptoms or conditions that are commonly associated with FND. These include: chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, back and neck pain, and complex regional pain syndrome - persistent fatigue - sleep problems including insomnia (not sleeping enough) and hypersomnia (sleeping too much) - migraines and other types of headache and facial pain - irritable bowel syndrome and other problems with the function of your stomach and bowel - anxiety and panic attacks"
What are the signs and symptoms of food poisoning?,"We know that the symptoms of FND happen because there's a problem with how the brain is sending and receiving messages to itself and other parts of the body. Using research tools, scientists can see that certain circuits in the brain are not working properly in people with FND."
What should I do if I suspect food poisoning?,"When diagnosing FND, your healthcare provider will carry out an assessment to see if there are typical clinical features of FND. Your healthcare provider may still choose to test for other diseases and conditions before diagnosing FND. This is because many conditions share the same symptoms and, in around a quarter of cases, FND is present alongside another neurological condition. Someone can have both FND and conditions like sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome, epilepsy, or multiple sclerosis (MS)."
When should I see a doctor about food poisoning?,FND is a really variable condition. Some people have quite short-lived symptoms. Others can have them for many years.
How does food become contaminated?,"Many people develop a fungal nail infection at some point in their life. It's not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and difficult to treat. The infection develops slowly and causes the nail to become discoloured, thickened and distorted."
What is functional neurological disorder?,"A fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first. As it progresses, the infection can cause: discolouration of the nail - thickening and distortion of the nail - pain or discomfort - brittle or crumbly nails"
What are the symptoms of functional neurological disorder?,"Most fungal nail infections occur as a result of the fungi that cause athlete's foot infecting the nails. These fungi often live harmlessly on your skin, but they can sometimes multiply and lead to infections. The fungi prefer warm, dark and moist places like the feet."
Are there any common associated symptoms or conditions with functional neurological disorder?,Treatment isn't always needed for a mild fungal nail infection because it's unlikely to cause any further problems and you may feel it's not worth treating.
What causes functional neurological disorder?,"You can reduce your risk of developing a fungal nail infection by: keeping your hands and feet clean and dry, wearing well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks – these will allow your feet to ""breathe"", clipping your nails to keep them short – don't share clippers or scissors with other people, not sharing towels and socks with other people, and ensure your towels are washed regularly"
How is functional neurological disorder diagnosed?,"Gallbladder cancer is very rare. There are a number of different types of gallbladder cancer, depending on the cells affected.Over 85% of gallbladder cancers are adenocarcinoma, which means the cancer started in the gland cells lining the gallbladder."
What are the treatment options for functional neurological disorder?,"The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that's located underneath the liver. It's main purpose is to store and concentrate bile. Bile is a liquid produced by the liver that helps to digest fats. It passes from the liver through a series of channels (bile ducts) into the gallbladder, where it's stored."
what is fungal nail infection?,"In the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn't cause symptoms, which means it could be at an advanced stage by the time it's diagnosed. Symptoms that occur at a later stage can include (abdominal (stomach) pain,  feeling sick, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes))"
What are the signs and symptoms of a fungal nail infection?,"In gallbladder cancer, abnormal cells grow within the gallbladder. It's not known why this happens, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing the condition."
How do you get a fungal nail infection?,"Your GP will examine you and ask about your symptoms. If they suspect gallbladder cancer, they may refer you to a specialist, usually a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions of the digestive system)."
What are the treatments available for fungal nail infections?,The main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.
How can fungal nail infections be prevented?,"Gallstones are small stones, usually made of cholesterol, that form in the gallbladder. In most cases they don't cause any symptoms and don't need to be treated."
What is gallbladder cancer?,Gallstones are thought to develop because of an imbalance in the chemical make-up of bile inside the gallbladder. In most cases the levels of cholesterol in bile become too high and the excess cholesterol forms into stones.
What is the gallbladder and its function?,Treatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing: symptoms (such as abdominal pain ) - complications (such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis)
What are the symptoms of gallbladder cancer?,"Ganglion cysts are soft, gel-like masses that often change size. They tend to be smooth and round, and are: the most common type of swelling in the hand, wrist and foot and harmless and can safely be left alone"
What causes gallbladder cancer?,"A ganglion cyst starts when the fluid leaks out of a joint or tendon tunnel and forms a swelling beneath the skin. The cause of the leak is generally unknown, but may be due to trauma or underlying arthritis."
How is gallbladder cancer diagnosed?,"If you have a ganglion cyst the swelling can become noticeable, but often there are no symptoms at all. Sometimes a ganglion can cause pain and limit movement in your joint. Some people are also concerned about the cysts appearance."
What are the treatment options for gallbladder cancer?,"To diagnose a ganglion cyst, a healthcare professional will ask you about it and examine your wrist and hand. Giving a diagnosis is usually straightforward. However, scans may be helpful if the diagnosis is uncertain."
what is gallstones?,About 50% of ganglions disappear on their own without treatment. In the early stages you should wait to see if this happens. You won't need treatment unless the cyst is painful.
What causes gallstones?,"Gastroenteritis is a very common condition that causes diarrhoea and vomiting. It's usually caused by a bacterial or viral tummy bug. It affects people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children."
How are gallstones treated?,"The main symptoms of gastroenteritis are sudden, watery diarrhoea - feeling sick - vomiting, which can be projectile - a mild fever. Some people also have other symptoms, such as a loss of appetite, an upset stomach, aching limbs and headaches."
what is ganglion cysts? ,"If you experience sudden diarrhoea and vomiting, the best thing to do is stay at home until you're feeling better. There's not always a specific treatment, so you have to let the illness run its course."
What causes ganglion cysts?,"You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you have gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own."
What are the symptoms of ganglion cysts?,You can look after your child at home if they have diarrhoea and vomiting. There's not usually any specific treatment and your child should start feeling better in a few days.
How are ganglion cysts diagnosed?,"You don't usually need to see your GP if you think your child has gastroenteritis, as it should get better on its own, and taking them to a GP surgery can put others at risk."
What are the treatment options for ganglion cysts?,The bugs that cause gastroenteritis can spread very easily from person to person. You can catch the infection if small particles of vomit or poo from an infected person get into your mouth.
what is gastroenteritis?,"It's not always possible to avoid getting gastroenteritis, but following the advice can help stop it spreading. Take extra care when travelling to parts of the world with poor sanitation, as you could pick up a stomach bug. For example, you may need to boil tap water before drinking it."
What are the symptoms of gastroenteritis?,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet). It usually occurs as a result of the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus becoming weakened. Read more about the causes of GORD."
What should I do if I have gastroenteritis?,"Symptoms of GORD can include: heartburn (an uncomfortable burning sensation in the chest that often occurs after eating) \ n acid reflux (where stomach acid comes back up into your mouth and causes an unpleasant, sour taste)  oesophagitis (a sore, inflamed oesophagus)  bad breath  bloating and belching  feeling or being sick  pain when swallowing and/or difficulty swallowing"
When should I seek medical advice for gastroenteritis?,You can often control the symptoms of GORD by making some lifestyle changes and taking over-the-counter medication.
How should I care for a child with gastroenteritis?,"Visit your GP if you're worried about your symptoms, or if: you have symptoms several times a week  over-the-counter medications aren't helping  your symptoms are severe  you have difficulty swallowing  you have possible signs of a more serious problem, such as persistent vomiting, vomiting blood or unexplained weight loss  Your GP will usually be able to diagnose GORD based on your symptoms, although they may refer you for some tests."
When should I seek medical advice for my child with gastroenteritis?,The main treatments for GORD are: self-help measures - over-the-counter medicines - stronger prescription medicines
How is gastroenteritis spread?,"If you have GORD for a long time, stomach acid can damage your oesophagus and cause further problems."
What can be done to prevent gastroenteritis?,"Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are 2 different types of the virus (type 1 and type 2), both of which can affect the genitals. One of the types is the same virus that causes cold sores around the mouth (type 1)."
What is gastro-oesophageal reflux disease?,"The herpes virus (HSV) is easily passed from person to person by close, direct contact including: kissing  unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom) sharing sex toys that aren't washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used  your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals – this means you can get genital herpes from someone even if there is no penetration, orgasm or ejaculation"
What are the symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease?,Many people with the herpes virus do not experience any symptoms when first infected. If symptoms do occur they usually take between 2 and 12 days after contact to appear.
What should I do if I have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease?,"If you think you may have genital herpes you should make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services. If there are symptoms present such as blisters, sores and ulcers, your doctor or nurse may be able to make a diagnosis straight away."
When should I see my doctor about gastro-oesophageal reflux disease?,"Although there is no known cure for herpes, the symptoms of genital herpes can be treated. The symptoms of recurrent genital herpes will usually clear up without any treatment. Anti-viral medication can help speed up the healing process and reduce the severity of an episode, if needed."
What are the treatment options for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease?,"You can only pass the virus on to someone who has not already been infected with the same type of herpes as you. If you have herpes, you can follow some simple measures to avoid passing the virus on to your partner(s), and to continue to have a healthy and happy sex life."
What are the potential complications of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease?,"The best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal or oral sex. Using condoms has been shown to half the risk of passing on herpes."
What is Genital herpes?,Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection caused by a virus called Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). This virus is passed on through direct skin-to-skin contact with someone who has HPV on their skin. It can be passed from person to person during vaginal and anal sex. It's also rarely passed on through oral sex.
How do you get genital herpes?,You get genital warts by touching your genitals with someone else’s genitals who carries the HPV virus. The virus may be present on the skin but no actual warts can be seen.
What are the symptoms of genital herpes?,"If you have genital warts, you may notice lumps or growths around your vagina, penis or anus that were not there before. However, you can carry the virus without developing actual warts."
How is testing done for genital herpes?,"A healthy immune system is usually able to clear the virus, or suppress it, over time. This means that eventually the warts would be cured."
What are the treatment options for genital herpes?,"Treatment for genital warts needs to be prescribed by a doctor or nurse. The type of treatment you'll be offered depends on what your warts are like. The doctor or nurse will discuss this with you. Treatment options include: (cream or liquid, freezing, surgery)"
How can passing on genital herpes to a partner be avoided?,"Warts can come back after you have managed to get rid of them. This may happen weeks, months or years after they first appeared."
What can be done to reduce the risk of genital herpes?,"Using a condom every time you have vaginal, anal or oral sex is the best way to avoid passing on genital warts to a partner. However, if the virus is present on skin not protected by a condom, it can still be passed on."
What is Genital warts?,"To reduce your risk of getting genital warts you should use a condom for vaginal, anal and oral sex. You can get warts even if you use condoms, as a condom does not cover the whole genital area."
How do you get genital warts?,Genital warts are not cancer and don't cause cancer. They're caused by a different strain of HPV. The HPV vaccine offered to girls and boys in the UK to protect against cervical cancer also protects against genital warts.
What are the symptoms of genital warts?,"Most children who develop germ cell tumours will be cured. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past."
How is testing done for genital warts?,The cause of germ cell tumours is unknown but research into the causes of different cancers is ongoing.
What are the treatment options for genital warts?,The symptoms depend on where the tumour develops. Usually it starts with a lump that can either be felt or causes other symptoms.
Can genital warts recur?,"Different tests may be needed to diagnose a germ cell tumour. Usually, the doctor will remove a sample of tissue from the lump (a biopsy) for examination under a microscope to find out if it is a cancer or not."
How can passing on genital warts to a partner be avoided?,"The treatment your child will have usually depends on a number of factors, including the size, position and stage of the tumour. It usually includes either surgery or chemotherapy, or a combination."
How can the risk of genital warts be reduced?,"Glandular fever is a type of viral infection that mostly affects young adults. It is also known as infectious mononucleosis, or ""mono""."
What is the connection between HPV and cancer?,"You should contact your GP if you suspect that you or your child has glandular fever. While there is little your GP can do in terms of treatment, they can provide advice and support to help you control your symptoms and reduce the risk of passing the infection on to others."
What are germ cell tumors?,"Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through: kissing - exposure to coughs and sneezes - sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery"
What causes germ cell tumors?,"Glandular fever can affect people of all ages, but most cases affect teenagers and young adults. Most EBV infections are thought to occur during childhood and cause only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all."
What are the signs and symptoms of germ cell tumors?,"To diagnose glandular fever, your GP will first ask about your symptoms before carrying out a physical examination. They will look for characteristic signs of glandular fever, such as swollen glands, tonsils, liver and spleen."
How are germ cell tumors diagnosed?,"There is no cure for glandular fever, but there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms while you wait for your body to control the infection."
What are the treatment options for germ cell tumors?,"Complications associated with glandular fever are uncommon, but when they do occur they can be serious. They can include:"
what is glandular fever?,Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacteria. The number of people getting gonorrhoea in Scotland has doubled over the last 5 years.
When should I seek medical advice about glandular fever?,"Gonorrhoea is passed from person to person through unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom). It can also be spread by: sharing sex toys that aren't washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used  infected semen or vaginal fluid getting into your eye  it can also be passed to a newborn during childbirth"
What causes glandular fever?,"Many people with gonorrhoea will not notice any symptoms. If symptoms do appear, they usually show up between 1 to 14 days after coming into contact with the infection."
Who is affected by glandular fever?,"If you think you have gonorrhoea you should make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services. The tests for gonorrhoea are simple, painless and very reliable."
How is glandular fever diagnosed?,Gonorrhoea is treated with antibiotics usually given as an injection. If this is not suitable it can in some cases be treated with tablets. Some strains of gonorrhoea are becoming resistant to antibiotics. This can make it more difficult to treat. Resistance is checked by sending an additional swab to look for resistance and re-testing for the infection 3 weeks after treatment.
How is glandular fever treated?,If you have gonorrhoea your partner will be offered testing and treatment. It's important to avoid sex until you and your partner have both finished the treatment for gonorrhoea and have had the results of the 2 week test to prevent reinfection.
What are the possible complications of glandular fever?,"The best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal or oral sex."
what is Gonorrhoea?,Gout is a type of arthritis in which small crystals form inside and around the joints. It causes sudden attacks of severe pain and swelling.
How do I get gonorrhea?,"Any joint can be affected by gout, but it usually affects joints towards the ends of the limbs, such as the toes, ankles, knees and fingers. Signs and symptoms of gout include: (severe pain in one or more joints, the joint feeling hot and very tender, swelling in and around the affected joint, red, shiny skin over the affected joint)"
What are the symptoms of gonorrhea?,"See your GP if you suspect you have gout and it hasn't been previously diagnosed, particularly if the pain keeps getting worse and you also have a high temperature (fever)."
How is testing done for gonorrhea?,"Gout is caused by a build-up of a substance called uric acid in the blood. If you produce too much uric acid or your kidneys don't filter enough out, it can build up and cause tiny sharp crystals to form in and around joints. These crystals can cause the joint to become inflamed (red and swollen) and painful."
What are the treatment options for gonorrhea?,"If you have gout, treatment is available from your GP to: relieve symptoms during an attack - prevent further attacks. With treatment, many people are able to reduce their uric acid levels sufficiently to dissolve the crystals that cause gout – and as a result have no further attacks. However, lifelong treatment is usually required."
How can passing on gonorrhea to a partner be avoided?,"Sometimes gout can lead to further problems, particularly if it's left untreated. These can include: kidney stones, small firm lumps of uric acid crystals under the skin called tophi, permanent joint damage"

When should I seek medical advice about hepatitis A?,"Hepatitis A is most widespread in parts of the world where standards of sanitation and food hygiene are generally poor, such as parts of Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, the Middle East, and Central and South America."
How can you get hepatitis A?,The hepatitis A vaccine is usually available for free on the NHS for anyone who needs it.
Is there a vaccine available for hepatitis A?,"There's currently no cure for hepatitis A, but it will normally pass on its own within a couple of months. You can usually look after yourself at home."
What are the treatments for hepatitis A?,"For most people, hepatitis A will pass within 2 months and there will be no long-term effects. Once it passes, you normally develop life-long immunity against the virus."
What is the outlook for hepatitis A?,"Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by a virus that's spread through blood and body fluids. It often doesn't cause any obvious symptoms in adults and typically passes in a few months without treatment, but in children it often persists for years and may eventually cause serious liver damage."
what is hepatitis B?,"Many people with hepatitis B won't experience any symptoms and may fight off the virus without realising they had it. If symptoms do develop, they tend to occur 2 or 3 months after exposure to the hepatitis B virus."
What are the symptoms of hepatitis B?,"Hepatitis B can be serious, so you should get medical advice if you think you may have been exposed to the hepatitis B virus or you have symptoms associated with hepatitis B or you're at a high risk of hepatitis B"
When should I seek medical advice about hepatitis B?,"Treatment for hepatitis B depends on how long you've been infected for  if you've been exposed to the virus in the last few days, emergency treatment can help stop you becoming infected  if you've only had the infection for a few weeks or months (acute hepatitis B), you may only need treatment to relieve your symptoms while your body fights off the infection  if you've had the infection for more than 6 months (chronic hepatitis B), you may be offered treatment with medicines that can keep the virus under control and reduce the risk of liver damage"
What are the treatments for hepatitis B?,"The hepatitis B virus is found in the blood and bodily fluids, such as semen and vaginal fluids, of an infected person. Hepatitis B isn't spread by kissing, holding hands, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or sharing crockery and utensils."

What is the outlook for hepatitis B?,"Hepatitis C is a virus that can infect the liver. If left untreated, it can sometimes cause serious and potentially life-threatening damage to the liver over many years."
what is hepatitis C?,Hepatitis C often doesn't have any noticeable symptoms until the liver has been significantly damaged. This means many people have the infection without realising it.
What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?,"The hepatitis C virus is usually spread through blood-to-blood contact. Some ways the infection can be spread include: sharing unsterilised needles, sharing razors or toothbrushes, from a pregnant woman to her unborn baby, through unprotected sex"
How do you contract hepatitis C?,"Seek medical advice if you have persistent symptoms of hepatitis C, or there's a risk you're infected, even if you don't have any symptoms. A blood test can be carried out to see if you have the infection."
How is hepatitis C diagnosed?,"Hepatitis C can be treated with a single, or combination of, medicines that stop the virus multiplying inside the body. Traditionally hepatitis C was treated with interferon (an injection) and ribavirin. New, all-oral medicines are now available for everyone and treatment is usually only for 8-12 weeks."
What are the treatment options for hepatitis C?,"If the infection is left untreated for many years, some people with hepatitis C will develop scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). Over time, this can cause the liver to stop working properly."
What are the complications of hepatitis C?,"There's no vaccine for hepatitis C, but there are ways to reduce your risk of becoming infected, such as: not sharing any drug-injecting equipment with other people – including needles and other equipment such as syringes, spoons and filters and not sharing razors or toothbrushes that might be contaminated with blood"
How can hepatitis C be prevented?,"A hiatus hernia, or hiatal hernia, is when part of the stomach squeezes up into the chest through an opening (""hiatus"") in the diaphragm. The diaphragm is a large, thin sheet of muscle between the chest and the abdomen (tummy)."
What is a hiatus hernia?,"A hiatus hernia itself rarely has any noticeable symptoms. However, it can cause a problem called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)."
How does a hiatus hernia relate to heartburn?,"It's not exactly clear what causes hiatus hernia, but it may be the result of the diaphragm becoming weak with age, or pressure on the abdomen."
What causes a hiatus hernia?,"Hiatus hernia can affect anyone, but it's more common in people who are: over 50 years of age or overweight or pregnant"
Who is affected by a hiatus hernia?,There are 2 main types of hiatus hernia. They are: sliding hiatus hernias and para-oesophageal hiatus hernias.
What are the different types of hiatus hernia?,"Treatment for a sliding hiatus hernia usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn. Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven't worked."
How is a hiatus hernia treated?,"It's rare for a hiatus hernia to cause complications, but long-term damage to the oesophagus caused by leaking stomach acid can lead to ulcers, scarring and changes to the cells of the oesophagus, which can increase your risk of oesophageal cancer."
Are there any further problems associated with a hiatus hernia?,"Cholesterol is a fatty substance known as a lipid. It's vital for the normal functioning of the body. Cell membranes, hormones and vitamin D are created by your body using cholesterol."
What is high cholesterol?,"Cholesterol is carried in your blood by proteins. When the two combine, they're called lipoproteins. There are two main types of lipoprotein."
What is cholesterol?,"Evidence strongly indicates that high cholesterol can increase the risk of: narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis), heart attack, stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) – often known as a ""mini stroke"", peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This is because cholesterol can build up in the artery wall, restricting the blood flow to your heart, brain and the rest of your body. It also increases the risk of a blood clot developing somewhere in your body."
Why should I lower my cholesterol?,Many factors can increase your chances of having heart problems or a stroke if you have high cholesterol.
What causes high cholesterol?,"Your GP may recommend that you have your blood cholesterol levels tested if you have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, stroke or mini stroke (TIA), or peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or you have a family history of early cardiovascular disease or you have a close family member who has a cholesterol-related condition, are overweight or you have high blood pressure, diabetes or a health condition that can increase cholesterol levels"
When should my cholesterol levels be tested?,"Blood cholesterol is measured in units called millimoles per litre of blood, often shortened to mmol/L."
What should my cholesterol levels be?,"The first step in reducing your cholesterol is to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. It's important to keep your diet low in fatty food. You can swap food containing saturated fat for fruit, vegetables and wholegrain cereals. This will also help prevent high cholesterol from returning."
How can I lower my cholesterol levels?,"HIV is a long term health condition which is now very easy to manage. HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. The virus targets the immune system and if untreated, weakens your ability to fight infections and disease."
what is HIV?,"HIV is found in body fluids of a person with the virus, whose levels of virus are detectable."
How do you contract HIV?,Seek healthcare advice as soon as possible if you think you might have been exposed to HIV. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have an HIV test. This involves testing a sample of your blood or occasionally saliva for signs of the infection. In NHS services this usually involves a blood test with results available within a few days.
How do I know if I have HIV?,"Treatments for HIV are now very effective, enabling people with HIV to live long and healthy lives. Medication, known as antiretrovirals, work by stopping the virus replicating in the body, allowing the immune system to repair itself and preventing further damage. These medicines usually come in the form of tablets, which need to be taken every day."
"What are the treatment options for HIV, and how can I live with it?","It has never been easier to prevent the transmission of HIV. Someone living with HIV who takes their HIV treatment and who has had an undetectable level of virus for six months, cannot transmit HIV to anyone else. Over 90% of all people diagnosed with HIV in Scotland have undetectable virus. It's therefore extremely rare for someone to get HIV from a person that knows they have the virus."
How can HIV be prevented?,"At the end of December 2019, there were 326 reports of HIV diagnoses in Scotland. Of these, 167 were first-ever HIV diagnoses and 158 had been previously diagnosed outwith Scotland, but were newly reported in Scotland during 2019. It's estimated that there are 6,122 individuals living with HIV in Scotland and of these 92% have been diagnosed. A total of 5,074 are attending specialist HIV treatment and care services. Of these, 98% are receiving antiretroviral therapy with 95% achieving an undetectable viral load."
How common is HIV?,"Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body."
what is Hodgkin lymphoma?,"Hodgkin lymphoma can develop at any age, but it mostly affects young adults in their early 20s and older adults over the age of 70. Slightly more men than women are affected."
Who is affected by Hodgkin lymphoma?,"The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system or you take immunosuppressant medication or you've previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus – which causes glandular fever"
What causes Hodgkin lymphoma?,The only way to confirm a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy. This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.
How is Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed?,"Hodgkin lymphoma is a relatively aggressive cancer and can quickly spread through the body. Despite this, it's also one of the most easily treated types of cancer."
What are the treatment options for Hodgkin lymphoma?,Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It can affect children at any age but is more common in older teenagers and young adults.
What is the introduction of Hodgkin lymphoma in Children?,"Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymphatic system. There are 2 main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical Hodgkin lymphoma, which affects 95% of patients, and Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma (LPHL), which only affects 5% of patients. This information is about classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but it includes a short section about LPHL."
What is Hodgkin lymphoma?,"The exact cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known. In most people that develop Hodgkin lymphoma, no cause is found. However, there is increasing evidence that infections, such as the virus that causes glandular fever, may play a part in the development of Hodgkin lymphoma, especially in childhood. Poor immunity may also be a risk factor for developing the disease. Very rarely, more than one member of a family may develop Hodgkin lymphoma but it is not inherited from parents and you cannot catch it from another person."
What are the causes of Hodgkin lymphoma in children?,"The first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is usually a painless swelling of 1 gland, or a group of lymph glands, which continues for some weeks or even months. The first glands that are likely to be affected are in the neck or above the collarbone, most often only on 1 side. However, it’s important to remember that children’s glands can also become swollen when they have a common infection that causes a sore throat or a cold. If glands in the chest are affected, this can cause a cough or breathlessness. This is caused by the pressure the glands exert on the airways."
What are the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma in children?,"As lymph glands can swell for lots of reasons, a biopsy is carried out to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. A biopsy is when a swollen lymph gland is removed and the cells are looked at under a microscope. It’s a small operation which is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Sometimes only a small part of the lymph gland has to be removed, which can be done under a local anaesthetic."
How is Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed?,"Children with Hodgkin lymphoma are usually treated with chemotherapy, but sometimes radiotherapy is also needed. The type and amount of treatment given depend on the stage of the disease when it is diagnosed. Your child’s doctor will discuss the treatment options with you."
What are the treatment options for Hodgkin lymphoma in children?,"This is a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma that affects around 5% of patients. LPHL usually grows at a slower rate than classical Hodgkin lymphoma and normally requires less intensive treatment. Young people with LPHL may have a single swollen gland or group of swollen glands in one area only, such as the neck or groin. The swollen gland often grows very slowly and may be present for many months before a biopsy and diagnosis happens. The biopsy and staging tests will be carried out as with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment given will depend on the stage of the disease, but most patients are diagnosed with an early stage of the disease."
What is lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma?,"As a parent, the fact that your child has cancer is one of the worst situations you can be faced with. You may have many emotions, such as fear, guilt, sadness, anger and uncertainty. These are all normal reactions and are part of the process that many parents go through at such a difficult time. It’s not possible to address here all of the feelings you may have. However, the CCLG booklet Children & Young People’s Cancer; A Parent’s Guide talks about the emotional impact of caring for a child with cancer and suggests sources of help and support."
Can you share your feelings about Hodgkin lymphoma in children?,"Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system, which is one of the body’s natural defences against infection. Lymphomas, like all cancers, are a disease of the body’s cells. Normally cells in our body divide and grow in a controlled way. But sometimes cells keep dividing and grow out of control. This is how cancer develops."
what is the introduction of Hodgkin lymphoma in teenagers and young adults?,"One of the most common symptoms is having a painless lump. The lump is caused by swollen lymph nodes. There may be one or more lumps and these may be in your neck, armpit or groin."
What are the symptoms of Hodgkin lymphoma in teenagers and young adults?,"It's not known what causes Hodgkin lymphoma. Research is going on to try to find out. Remember, though, it isn't anything that you’ve done."
What causes Hodgkin lymphoma in teenagers and young adults?,Huntington's disease is a condition that damages nerve cells in the brain causing them to stop working properly. It's passed on (inherited) from a person's parents.
What is Huntington's disease?,People can start to show the symptoms of Huntington's disease at almost any age. Most will develop problems between the ages of 30 and 50.
What are the symptoms of Huntington's disease?,"Juvenile Huntington's disease is a rare form of the condition that can occur in people under the age of 20. Common signs include: a rapid decline in school performance, changes in handwriting, problems with movement, such as slowness, stiffness, tremor or muscle twitching (similar to the features of Parkinson's disease), seizures (fits)"
Is there a specific type of Huntington's disease called juvenile Huntington's disease?,Huntington's disease is caused by a faulty gene. Cells in parts of the brain are very sensitive to the effects of the faulty gene. This makes them function poorly and eventually die.
What causes Huntington's disease?,"If you have symptoms of Huntington's disease, your GP will refer you to a specialist clinician. They'll examine you and test your thinking, eye movements, balance and walking. They'll find out if you have any involuntary movements, such as chorea (fidgety or jerky movements)."
How is Huntington's disease diagnosed?,"There's no cure for Huntington's disease. Medication and therapies can help treat some of the symptoms. Speech and language therapy and occupational therapy, can help with communication and day-to-day living."
What are the available treatments for Huntington's disease?,"Most of these medications have side effects, like tiredness. It can sometimes be difficult to tell if the side effects are symptoms of the condition or a result of the medication."
Are there medications available for Huntington's disease?,"Help is available to assist people with Huntington's disease in their day-to-day life. This might include physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy."
How do individuals live with Huntington's disease?,"High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is usually defined as having a sustained blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above."
What is high blood pressure?,"The heart is a muscle that is designed to constantly pump blood around the body. It pumps blood that is low in oxygen towards the lungs, through the venous 'pipeline' (veins), where it receives a fresh supply of oxygen."
what is the relation between the heart and blood pump?,"Blood pressure is defined as the amount of pressure that is exerted on the artery walls as blood moves through them. It is measured in millimetres of mercury, or mmHg."
How is blood pressure measured?,"High blood pressure often causes no symptoms, or immediate problems. The only way to find out whether you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked regularly. Ask your GP when you are next due for yours to be checked."
What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?,"High blood pressure is a common condition, it is estimated that 18% of adult men and 13% of adult women have high blood pressure but are not getting treatment for it."

What are the potential impacts of having high blood pressure?,"High blood pressure can be managed or controlled by making changes to your lifestyle, such as: eating a healthier diet, exercising more regularly, reducing the amount of alcohol that you drink."
How is high blood pressure treated and prevented?,Hyperhidrosis is a common condition in which a person sweats excessively.
What is hyperhidrosis?,"There are no guidelines to determine what ""normal"" sweating is, but if you feel you sweat too much and your sweating has started to interfere with your everyday daily life, you may have hyperhidrosis."
What is excessive sweating in hyperhidrosis?,"Visit your GP if you feel that your sweating is interfering with your daily activities, or you suddenly start sweating excessively."
When should I see a doctor about hyperhidrosis?,"In many cases, hyperhidrosis has no obvious cause and is thought to be the result of a problem with the part of the nervous system that controls sweating. This is known as primary hyperhidrosis."
What causes hyperhidrosis?,"Excessive sweating can be challenging to treat and it may take a while to find a treatment right for you. Doctors usually recommend starting with the least invasive treatment first, such as powerful antiperspirants. Lifestyle changes may also help."
How is hyperhidrosis treated?,Hyperhidrosis is common. It's been estimated to affect between 1 and 3 in every 100 people which means there are likely to be hundreds of thousands of people living with it.
Who is affected by hyperhidrosis?,"Hypoglycaemia, or a ""hypo"", is an abnormally low level of glucose in your blood (less than four millimoles per litre). When your glucose (sugar) level is too low, your body doesn't have enough energy to carry out its activities."
what is the introduction of hypoglycemia?,"Most people will have some warning that their blood glucose levels are too low, which gives them time to correct them. Symptoms usually occur when blood sugar levels fall below four millimoles (mmol) per litre."
What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?,"The immediate treatment for hypoglycaemia is to have some food or drink that contains sugar, such as dextrose tablets or fruit juice, to correct your blood glucose levels."

What causes kidney infections?,"Kidney infections are relatively rare. It's estimated that one in every 830 people develops a kidney infection each year. They can happen at any age, but are much more common in women. In fact, women are six times more likely to get a kidney infection than men. This is because a woman's urethra is shorter, making it easier for bacteria to reach the kidneys."
Who is at risk of kidney infections?,"You can reduce your chances of developing a kidney infection by keeping your bladder and urethra free from bacteria. This can include drinking plenty of fluids, keeping your genitals clean and treating any constipation."
Can kidney infections be prevented?,"Kidney stones can develop in one or both kidneys and most often affect people aged 30 to 60. They're quite common, with around three in 20 men and up to two in 20 women developing them at some stage of their lives."

What is Hepatocellular carcinoma?,"The liver is the largest organ in the body. It's surrounded by a fibrous capsule and is divided into sections called lobes. It lies across the upper part of the abdomen and is larger on the right-hand side of the body than on the left. It’s surrounded, and protected from injury, by the lower ribs."
What is The liver?,"The cause of most primary liver tumours in the western world is unknown. However, in other parts of the world, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is commonly related to the presence of liver infection. This happens in countries where mothers commonly have hepatitis B and vaccination is not readily available at birth for their children."
What causes Liver tumours?,"The most common symptom is a lump or swelling in the abdomen, which can be painful. Other possible symptoms include weight loss, a loss of appetite, feeling sick (nausea) and being sick (vomiting)."
What are the signs and symptoms of liver tumours?,"A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a liver tumour. An ultrasound scan and X-rays will be taken, which can show if there is a tumour in the liver. Further tests, including CT (computerised tomography) scans or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, will be done to find out the extent of the disease, both inside and outside the liver. Blood tests will also be carried out."

If you've been in a relationship for a long time, you may have become overfamiliar with your partner and feel a degree of erotic dissatisfaction. This is quite common and can have a negative effect on your sex drive.  Relationship problems are among the most common causes of loss of libido. For help and advice, you may find it useful to contact the relationship support charity Relationships Scotland."
What relationship problems can contribute to loss of libido?,"Stress, anxiety and exhaustion can be all-consuming and have a major impact on your happiness. If you feel you're constantly tired, stressed or anxious, you may need to make some lifestyle changes or speak to your GP for advice."
How does depression affect libido?,"Depression is very different from simply feeling unhappy, miserable or fed up for a short while. It's a serious illness where you may have feelings of extreme sadness that can last for a long time. These feelings are severe enough to interfere with your daily life, including your sex life."
How can drugs and alcohol affect libido?,"Drinking excess amounts of alcohol can reduce your sex drive, so it's a good idea to moderate your intake to no more than three to four units a day if you're a man, and no more than two to three units a day if you're a woman."
How does getting older affect libido?,"Many people lose some interest in sex as they get older, mainly as a result of falling levels of sex hormones, age-related health problems, or the side effects of medication. Older men especially can develop low testosterone levels, which can cause fatigue, depression and a reduced sex drive."
What hormonal problems can cause loss of libido?,"Less commonly, low libido may be caused by an underactive thyroid. This is where your thyroid gland (located in the neck) doesn't produce enough hormones. Common signs of an underactive thyroid are tiredness, weight gain and feeling depressed."
How can contraception affect libido?,"Some women have reported a decreased sex drive while using some types of hormonal contraception, such as: combined contraception, including the combined pill - aginal ring, or contraceptive patch - the progestogen-only pill - the contraceptive implant - the Depo-Provera injection"
How can medication affect libido?,See your GP if you're worried that medication you're taking is responsible for your reduced sex drive. They can review your medication and switch your prescription to something less likely to affect your libido if necessary.
What is lung cancer?,Lung cancer is one of the most common and serious types of cancer.
What are the signs and symptoms of lung cancer?,"There are usually no signs or symptoms in the early stages of lung cancer, but many people with the condition eventually develop symptoms including: a persistent cough - coughing up blood - persistent breathlessness - unexplained tiredness and weight loss - an ache or pain when breathing or coughing"
What are the types of lung cancer?,Cancer that begins in the lungs is called primary lung cancer. Cancer that spreads from the lungs to another place in the body is known as secondary lung cancer. This page is about primary lung cancer.
Who is affected by lung cancer?,"Lung cancer mainly affects older people. It's rare in people younger than 40, and the rates of lung cancer rise sharply with age. Lung cancer is most commonly diagnosed in people aged 70 to 74."
How is lung cancer treated?,"Treatment depends on the type of cancer, how far it's spread and how good your general health is. If the condition is diagnosed early and the cancerous cells are confined to a small area, surgery to remove the affected area of lung is usually recommended."
What is lupus?,Lupus is a complex and poorly understood condition that affects many parts of the body and causes symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening.
What are the types of lupus?,There are some types of lupus that just affect the skin – such as discoid lupus erythematosus and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Some medications can also cause lupus-like side effects.
What are the signs and symptoms of lupus?,"SLE can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on the areas of the body that are affected. The most common symptoms are: fatigue (extreme tiredness), rashes (particularly on the face, wrists and hands), joint pain and swelling"
What causes lupus?,"SLE is an autoimmune condition, which means it is caused by problems with the immune system. For reasons not yet understood, the immune system in people with SLE starts to attack and inflame healthy cells, tissue and organs."
Who is affected by lupus?,"SLE is an uncommon condition where around 90% of cases occur in women. The condition is most common in women of childbearing age (between the ages of 15 and 50), but it can also affect people of other ages."
How is lupus treated?,"There is currently no cure for SLE, but there are different medications that can help relieve many of the symptoms and reduce the chances of organ damage."
What is Lyme disease?,"Lyme disease is a bacterial infection spread to humans by infected ticks. It's also known as Lyme borreliosis. Ticks are tiny spider-like creatures found in woodland and moorland areas. They feed on the blood of birds and mammals, including humans."
What are the symptoms of Lyme disease?,Many people with early symptoms of Lyme disease develop a circular rash around the tick bite. Some people may develop several rashes in different parts of their body. Around 1 in 3 people with Lyme disease won't develop a rash.
What are the other symptoms of Lyme disease?,"Some people with Lyme disease also have flu-like symptoms in the early stages, like: tiredness (fatigue) - muscle pain - joint pain - headaches - a high temperature (fever) - chills - neck stiffness"
What are the later symptoms of Lyme disease?,More serious symptoms may develop if Lyme disease is left untreated or is not treated early. These can include: pain and swelling in the joints - nerve problems - memory problems - difficulty concentrating - heart problems
How do you get Lyme disease?,"If a tick bites an animal carrying the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, the tick can become infected. The tick can then transfer the bacteria to a human by biting them."
Where are ticks found in relation to Lyme disease?,"They can be found in any areas with deep or overgrown plants where they have access to animals to feed on. They're common in woodland and moorland areas, but can also be found in gardens or parks."
Who is at risk of Lyme disease?,The risk of getting Lyme disease is higher: for people who spend time in woodland or moorland areas and from March to October because more people take part in outdoor activities
How is Lyme disease diagnosed?,Diagnosing Lyme disease is often difficult as many of the symptoms are similar to other conditions. There are 2 kinds of blood test use to diagnose Lyme disease. The tests are not always accurate in the early stages of Lyme disease. So you may need tested more than once if you still have symptoms after a negative result.
How is Lyme disease treated?,"If you have symptoms of Lyme disease, you'll normally be given antibiotics. If you're prescribed antibiotics, it's important you finish the course even if you're feeling better. This'll help ensure all the bacteria are killed."
How can Lyme disease be prevented?,There's currently no vaccine available to prevent Lyme disease. The best way to prevent it is to adopt easy habits when you're in the countryside or near wildlife.
What is lymphoedema?,"Lymphoedema is a chronic (long-term) condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs."
What causes lymphoedema?,Lymphoedema is caused by a problem with the lymphatic system. This is a network of vessels and glands distributed throughout the body. Its major functions are helping to fight infection and drain excess fluid from tissues.
Who is affected by lymphoedema?,"A recent study has suggested that over 200,000 people in the UK may be living with lymphoedema. Secondary lymphoedema has been shown to affect approximately one in five women after breast cancer treatment."
How is lymphoedema treated?,"There is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system."
What are the complications of lymphoedema?,"The build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection. In particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called cellulitis is commonly reported in people with the condition."
What is Lymphogranuloma venereum?,Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a particular strain of chlamydia bacteria. LGV is relatively rare in Scotland and is mostly acquired by men who have sex with men. LGV in women is very rare.
How do I get Lymphogranuloma venereum?,"The main way of getting LGV is by having unprotected anal, vaginal or oral sex (without a condom)."
What are the symptoms of Lymphogranuloma venereum?,"Some people with LGV may have no symptoms but can still pass on the infection to their partner(s). Symptoms can include swollen lymph glands in the groin on one or both sides or an ulcer or sore on the penis, vagina or around the anus."
How is Lymphogranuloma venereum tested?,"If you think you may have LGV you should make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services. When testing for LGV, a swab is taken from the back passage (rectum), vagina, throat or an ulcer (if you have one). A pee (urine) sample can also be used."
How is Lymphogranuloma venereum treated?,"LGV is usually treated with an antibiotic called doxycycline which is taken twice a day for 3 weeks. Sometimes different antibiotics are used. As the result of the LGV test can take 3 weeks to come back, your doctor may advise you to start treatment before the final result is available."
How can passing Lymphogranuloma venereum to a partner be avoided?,"To avoid passing LGV on to your partner you should avoid having sex until both you and your partner have finished all your antibiotic treatment. This includes oral sex, and sex with condoms."
How can the risk of Lymphogranuloma venereum be reduced?,"The best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal or oral sex. If you have a new partner, make sure that you both have a sexual health check-up before you have sex without condoms."
What is malaria?,"Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If it isn't diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal. A single mosquito bite is all it takes for someone to become infected."
What are the symptoms of malaria?,It's important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you're travelling to areas where there's a high risk of the disease. This means that you can get medical attention quickly. The initial symptoms of malaria include: a high temperature (fever) - headache - sweats - chills - muscle aches or pains - vomiting and or diarrhoea
When should medical attention be sought for malaria?,Malaria is a serious illness that can get worse very quickly. It can be fatal if not treated quickly.
What causes malaria?,Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. There are 5 different types of Plasmodium parasite that cause malaria in humans. They are found in different parts of the world (but do overlap in certain areas) and vary in terms of how severe the infection can be.
How is malaria spread?,The Plasmodium parasite is spread by mosquitoes. These are known as 'night-biting' mosquitoes because they most commonly bite between sunset and sunrise.
Where is malaria found?,Malaria is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is not found in the UK or Europe.
What are the complications of malaria?,Malaria is a serious illness that can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated quickly. Severe complications of malaria can occur within hours or days of the first symptoms. This means it is important to seek urgent medical help as soon as possible.
What are the other complications of malaria?,Other complications that can arise as a result of severe malaria include: liver failure and jaundice - shock - pulmonary oedema - acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - abnormally low blood sugar - swelling and rupturing of the spleen - dehydration
How does malaria affect pregnancy?,"If you get malaria while pregnant, you and your baby have an increased risk of developing serious complications like: premature birth - restricted growth of the baby in the womb - stillbirth - miscarriage - death of the mother. Pregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to regions with a risk of malaria."
What is malignant brain tumours?,"A malignant brain tumour is a fast-growing cancer that spreads to other areas of the brain and spine. Generally, brain tumours are graded from 1 to 4, according to their behaviour, such as how fast they grow and how likely they are to grow back after treatment. A malignant brain tumour is either grade 3 or 4, whereas grade 1 or 2 tumours are usually classed as benign or non-cancerous."
What are the signs and symptoms of malignant brain tumours?,"The symptoms of a malignant brain tumour depend on how big it is and where it is in the brain. Common symptoms include: severe, persistent headaches, seizures (fits), persistent nausea, vomiting and drowsiness, mental or behavioural changes, such as memory problems or changes in personality, progressive weakness or paralysis on one side of the body, vision problems, or speech problems"
What are the types of malignant brain tumours?,"Most malignant brain tumours develop from the glial tissue, which supports the brain's nerve cells. These tumours are known as gliomas. Gliomas can be separated further, depending on the cells they developed from."
Who is affected by malignant brain tumours?,"Brain tumours can affect people of any age, including children, although they tend to be more common in older adults. The exact cause of primary malignant brain tumours is unknown, although it's thought that certain genetic conditions and previous radiotherapy treatment to the head may increase the risk of one developing."
How are malignant brain tumours treated?,"A primary malignant brain tumour needs to be treated as soon as possible, because it can spread and damage other parts of the brain and spinal cord."
How can living with a brain tumour be managed?,Living with a brain tumour is not easy. You may feel worried and anxious about what's going to happen to you and your family. This is perfectly normal.
What support is available for carers of malignant brain tumour patients?,"Being a carer is not an easy role. When you are busy responding to the needs of others, it can deplete your reserves of emotional and physical energy, and make it easy for you to forget your own health and mental wellbeing."
What is About Malnutrition?,"Malnutrition means ""poor nutrition"" which can be caused by undernutrition or overnutrition. Malnutrition can result in unplanned weight loss, a low body mass index (BMI) and vitamin and mineral deficiencies. This can leave you feeling tired, weak and affect your ability to recover from an illness."
What conditions can cause malnutrition?,Certain medical conditions can cause increased requirements or lead to your body being unable to absorb or use nutrients properly.
What are the other causes of malnutrition?,"Malnutrition can also be caused by physical issues, social issues and ageing."
What are the signs and symptoms of malnutrition?,"Malnutrition can be difficult to recognise and can happen very gradually, which can make it very difficult to spot in the early stages. Common signs and symptoms to watch out for include: loss of appetite and lack of interest in food and/or fluids - unplanned weight loss - tiredness or low energy levels - reduced ability to perform everyday tasks - reduced muscle strength - changes in mood - poor concentration - poor growth in children - increased risk of infection, recurrent infections, taking longer to recover and poor wound healing - difficulty keeping warm - dizziness"
How is malnutrition diagnosed?,"A health care professional can assess you for malnutrition using a screening tool such as ‘Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool’ (‘MUST’). This tool assesses individuals as being at low, medium or high risk of malnutrition."
How is malnutrition treated?,"If you have lost weight or your appetite is poor, making simple changes to your meals, snacks and drinks may help. Choosing nutrient-dense food and drinks can help improve your calorie intake without having to make the portion size much bigger. This advice may not be suitable for everyone, especially those with other conditions such as diabetes or swallowing difficulties."
What are oral nutritional supplements?,"Oral nutritional supplements (often shortened to ONS) are a range of liquid and powder products that can be recommended, within certain circumstances, to help support better nutrition."
What is tube feeding?,"In certain situations, hospital admission may be required. A full assessment will be carried out by all or some of the following people: Doctor - Dietitian - Specialist Nurse - Pharmacist"
What is measles?,"Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can be very unpleasant and sometimes lead to serious complications. Anyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before, although it's most common in young children."
What are the symptoms of measles?,"The initial symptoms of measles develop around 10 days after you're infected. These can include: cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and a cough - sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light - a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F) - small greyish-white spots on the inside of the cheeks"
Is measles a serious condition?,"Measles can be unpleasant, but will usually pass in about 7 to 10 days without causing any further problems. Once you've had measles, your body builds up resistance (immunity) to the virus and it's highly unlikely you'll get it again."
How is measles spread?,The measles virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
How can measles be prevented?,"Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This is given in two doses as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme. The first dose is given when your child is around 12 months old and a second dose is given from age 3 years 4 months."
How is measles treated?,"There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection, including: taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains  drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration  closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity  using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes  staying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears."
What is meningitis?,"Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord (meninges). It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults."
What are the symptoms of meningitis?,Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include: a high temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F) - being sick - a headache - a blotchy rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won't always develop) - a stiff neck - a dislike of bright lights - drowsiness or unresponsiveness - seizures (fits)
When should medical help be sought for meningitis?,You should get medical advice as soon as possible if you're concerned that you or your child could have meningitis. Trust your instincts and don't wait until a rash develops.
How is meningitis spread?,"Meningitis is usually caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Bacterial meningitis is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis. Infections that cause meningitis can be spread through (sneezing, coughing, kissing, sharing utensils, cutlery and toothbrushes)"
What vaccinations are available against meningitis?,"Vaccinations offer some protection against certain causes of meningitis. These include the meningitis B vaccine , the 6-in-1 vaccine, the pneumococcal vaccine, the meningitis C vaccine, the MMR vaccine, the meningitis ACWY vaccine"
What are the treatments for meningitis?,People with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.
What is the outlook for meningitis?,"Viral meningitis will usually get better on its own and rarely causes any long-term problems. Most people with bacterial meningitis who are treated quickly will also make a full recovery, although some are left with serious, long-term problems."
What is mesothelioma?,Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops in the lining that covers the outer surface of some of the body's organs. It's usually linked to asbestos exposure.
What are the symptoms of mesothelioma?,"The symptoms of mesothelioma tend to develop gradually over time. They typically don't appear until several decades after exposure to asbestos. Symptoms of mesothelioma in the lining of the lungs include: chest pain - shortness of breath - fatigue (extreme tiredness) - a high temperature (fever) and sweating, particularly at night - a persistent cough - loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss - clubbed (swollen) fingertips"
What causes mesothelioma?,"Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos, a group of minerals made of microscopic fibres that used to be widely used in construction."
How is mesothelioma diagnosed?,"If your GP suspects mesothelioma, they will refer you to a hospital specialist for some tests. A number of different tests may need to be carried out, including: an X-ray of your chest or tummy - a computerised tomography (CT) scan - fluid drainage - a thoracoscopy or laparoscopy"
What are the treatments for mesothelioma?,"The best treatment for mesothelioma depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health. As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. This is known as palliative or supportive care. Possible treatments include: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery"
What is middle ear infections?,Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum. Anyone can develop a middle ear infection but infants between six and 15 months old are most commonly affected.
What are the symptoms of middle ear infections?,"In most cases, the symptoms of a middle ear infection (otitis media) develop quickly and resolve in a few days. This is known as acute otitis media. The main symptoms include: earache, a high temperature (fever), being sick, a lack of energy, slight hearing loss"
What are the signs in young children indicating a middle ear infection?,"As babies are unable to communicate the source of their discomfort, it can be difficult to tell what's wrong with them. Signs that a young child might have an ear infection include: raised temperature - pulling, tugging or rubbing their ear - irritability, poor feeding or restlessness at night - coughing or a runny nose - unresponsiveness to quiet sounds or other signs of difficulty hearing, such as inattentiveness - loss of balance"
When should medical advice be sought for middle ear infections?,"Most cases of otitis media pass within a few days, so there's usually no need to see your GP."
How are middle ear infections treated?,"Most ear infections clear up within three to five days and don't need any specific treatment. If necessary, paracetamol or ibuprofen should be used to relieve pain and a high temperature."
What causes middle ear infections?,"Most middle ear infections occur when an infection such as a cold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear and causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked."
Can middle ear infections be prevented?,"It's not possible to prevent middle ear infections, but there are some things you can do that may reduce your child's risk of developing the condition."
What are the potential further problems associated with middle ear infections?,"Complications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious if they do occur."
What is Migraine?,"Migraine is a common health condition. It affects around 1 in every 5 women and around 1 in every 15 men. They usually begin in early adulthood. A migraine is usually a moderate or severe headache felt as a throbbing pain on one side of the head. Many people also have symptoms like nausea, vomiting and increased sensitivity to light or sound."
What are the types of migraines?,"There are several types of migraine, including: migraine with aura (where there are warning signs before the migraine begins, like seeing flashing lights), migraine without aura (the most common type, where the migraine occurs without warning signs), migraine aura without headache, also known as silent migraine (where an aura or other migraine symptoms are experienced, without a headache)"
What are the symptoms of a migraine?,"The main symptom of a migraine is usually an intense headache on one side of the head. In some cases, the pain can occur on both sides of your head and may affect your face or neck."
What causes a migraine?,"The exact cause of migraines is unknown. They're thought to be the result of abnormal brain activity temporarily affecting nerve signals, chemicals and blood vessels in the brain."
What are common triggers for migraines?,"Possible migraine triggers include: Hormonal changes - Emotional triggers - Physical triggers ( tiredness, poor quality sleep, shift work, poor posture)- Dietary triggers (dehydration, alcohol, the food additive tyramine, caffeine products) - Environmental triggers(smoking , loud noises, strong smells) - Medication (some types of sleeping tablets, the combined contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy (HRT))"
How are migraines diagnosed?,"There's no specific test to diagnose migraines. For an accurate diagnosis, your GP must identify a pattern of recurring headaches along with the associated symptoms. Migraines can be unpredictable, sometimes occurring without the other symptoms. Obtaining an accurate diagnosis can sometimes take time."
How are migraines treated?,"There's no cure for migraines. There are treatments available to help reduce the symptoms. During an attack, many people find that sleeping or lying in a darkened room can also help."
What are the treatment options during pregnancy and breastfeeding?,"In general, migraine treatment with medicines should be limited as much as possible when you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Instead, trying to identify and avoid potential migraine triggers is recommended. If medication is essential, paracetamol and sumatriptan are safe to take during pregnancy and when breastfeeding."
How can migraines be prevented?,"It's important to maintain a generally healthy lifestyle, including: regular exercise, sleep and meals - ensuring you stay well hydrated - limiting your intake of caffeine - limiting your intake of alcohol"
What are the complications associated with migraines?,Migraines are linked to a very small increased risk of mental health problems. Migraines with aura are associated with a small increased risk of ischaemic strokes.
What is miscarriage?,A miscarriage is the loss of your baby before 24 weeks. Early miscarriages happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Late miscarriages happen between 12 and 24 weeks.
What causes a miscarriage?,Doctors think most miscarriages are caused when the building blocks controlling the development of a baby (the chromosomes) aren’t right. Babies with too many or not enough chromosomes won't develop properly. This leads to a miscarriage.
What are early miscarriages?,An early miscarriage happens in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Most women who miscarry do so in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy. Many women have a miscarriage before they even know they’re pregnant. If this happens it can feel like a late period with heavy bleeding.
What are the symptoms of an early miscarriage?,"You might be having a late miscarriage if: you're bleeding from your vagina (this can be heavy and you might have blood clots) or you've strong, cramping pains."
What is bleeding in early abortions?,Having some light bleeding's fairly common in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and doesn't necessarily mean you're having a miscarriage.
What happens during an early miscarriage?,If you’re in the early weeks of pregnancy:  you’ll probably be asked to go to the early pregnancy unit at your local hospital straight away  you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan  your body usually completes the miscarriage naturally
What are late miscarriages?,"A late miscarriage happens after 12 weeks and before 24 weeks. For many parents who lose their baby after a late miscarriage, the word ‘miscarriage’ doesn't properly express the impact of their loss. The loss of a baby at any time's a terrible shock and a late miscarriage can be especially hard."
What are the symptoms of a late miscarriage?,"You might be having a late miscarriage if:  you're bleeding from your vagina (this can be heavy and you might have blood clots) or you've strong, cramping pains"
What happens during a late miscarriage?,If you’re later on in pregnancy:  you may be asked to go to the maternity ward  you’ll have some tests and usually an ultrasound scan  you're likely to go through labour in hospital and might have your labour induced
How do people make difficult decisions after a miscarriage?,"You may have many difficult decisions to make at this time and will have overwhelming emotions. Take your time. Your midwife or doctor can help, and there are many organisations that can support you, your baby’s father and your family."
What should one expect after a miscarriage?,"Depending on your circumstances and stage of pregnancy, your midwife or doctor may ask if you'd like to see or hold your baby. Some parents decide they don't want to see their baby, and others choose not to for faith or cultural reasons. This is a decision only you can make. It can be very hard when you're feeling overwhelmed. Whatever you decide is okay."
What are repeated miscarriages?,"Most women go on to have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby after a miscarriage. But unfortunately, some women have repeated miscarriages."
What about Motor neurone disease?,"Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. This leads to muscle weakness, often with visible wasting."
What are the symptoms of motor neurone disease?,The symptoms of MND start gradually over weeks and months. They tend to appear on one side of the body first and get progressively worse.
What causes motor neurone disease?,MND occurs when specialist nerve cells (motor neurones) in the brain and spinal cord progressively fail. It's not clear why this happens.
What are the genetic causes of motor neurone disease?,One known cause of MND is an error in your genes with 20% of cases linked to genetic causes. Half of genetic cases will be in people who have a family history of MND. The other half of genetic cases will occur in those without a family history.
What are other possible causes of motor neurone disease?,It's unclear why the motor neurones begin to lose function. Most experts believe that it's a combination of factors that affect either the motor neurones or the cells that support them. There are some theories involving different cell processes including: Aggregates and RNA processing - Cell transport disruption - Glial cells - Glutamate - Mitochondria
How is motor neurone disease diagnosed?,"Speak to your GP if you experience the initial symptoms of MND. After hearing about your symptoms and an initial exam, your GP might refer you to a neurologist (a doctor who specialises in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system)."
How is motor neurone disease treated?,"Although there's no cure for MND, there are treatments available to help relieve the symptoms. A team of healthcare professionals will work together to help care for you."
What advice is available for carers of individuals with motor neurone disease?,Caring for someone with MND can be both physically and emotionally demanding. It's likely you'll need a wide range of support.
What about mouth cancer?,"Mouth cancer, also known as oral cancer, is where a tumour develops on the surface of the tongue, mouth, lips or gums. Tumours can also occur in the salivary glands, tonsils and the pharynx (the part of the throat from your mouth to your windpipe) but these are less common."
What are the symptoms of mouth cancer?,Symptoms of mouth cancer include red or white patches on the lining of your mouth or tongue and ulcers and a lump.
What are the types of mouth cancer?,"A cancer that develops on the inside or outside layer of the body is called a carcinoma and these types of cancer are categorised by the type of cells the cancer starts in. Less common types of mouth cancer include oral malignant melanoma (where the cancer starts in cells called melanocytes, which help give skin its colour) and adenocarcinomas (cancers that develop inside the salivary glands)"
What causes mouth cancer?,"Mouth cancer occurs when something goes wrong with the normal cell lifecycle, causing them to grow and reproduce uncontrollably. Risk factors for developing mouth cancer include: smoking or using products that contain tobacco - drinking alcohol - infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV), the virus that causes genital warts"
Who is affected by mouth cancer?,Mouth cancer is an uncommon type of cancer. Most cases of mouth cancer first develop in older adults who are aged between 50 and 74 years old.
How is mouth cancer treated?,"There are 3 main treatment options for mouth cancer. They are: surgery ( where the cancerous cells are surgically removed and, in some cases, some of the surrounding tissue ), chemotherapy (where powerful medications are used to kill cancerous cells), radiotherapy (where high energy X-rays are used to kill cancerous cells)"
What are the complications of mouth cancer?,"Both surgery and radiotherapy can make speaking and swallowing difficult (dysphagia). Dysphagia can be a potentially serious problem. If small pieces of food enter your airways and become lodged in your lungs, it could trigger a chest infection, known as aspiration pneumonia."
How can the risk of mouth cancer be reduced?,The three most effective ways to prevent mouth cancer from developing – or prevent it reocurring after successful treatment – are: not smoking - keeping to the recommended limits for alcohol consumption - eating a 'Mediterranean-style diet' . It's also important that you have regular dental check-ups because dentists can often spot the early stages of mouth cancer.
What are mouth ulcers? ,"Mouth ulcers are painful sores that appear in the mouth. Although they're uncomfortable, they’re usually harmless and most clear up by themselves within a week or two."
What does a mouth ulcer look like?,"Mouth ulcers are usually round or oval sores that commonly appear inside the mouth on the: cheeks, lips, tongue. They can be white, red, yellow or grey in colour and swollen. It's possible to have more than one mouth ulcer at a time and they may spread or grow."
When should professional advice be sought for mouth ulcers?,"It's usually safe to treat mouth ulcers at home, although your pharmacist may advise that yousee your GP or dentist if your mouth ulcer has lasted three weeks or you keep getting mouth ulcers or your mouth ulcer becomes more painful or red"
How can mouth ulcers be treated?,"Mouth ulcers don’t usually need to be treated, because they tend to clear up by themselves within a week or two. However, treatment can help to reduce swelling and ease any discomfort. This may help if you keep getting mouth ulcers or your mouth ulcer affects eating and drinking."
How can mouth ulcers be differentiated from mouth cancer?,"In a few cases, a long-lasting mouth ulcer can be a sign of mouth cancer. Ulcers caused by mouth cancer usually appear on or under the tongue, although you can get them in other areas of the mouth."
What causes mouth ulcers?,"In many cases, the reason for mouth ulcers is unclear. Most single mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the lining inside of the mouth."
Can mouth ulcers be prevented?,"It may not be possible to prevent mouth ulcers, because they're often caused by things you can't control (such as a family history or a medical condition)."
What about multiple myeloma?,"Multiple myeloma, also known as myeloma, is a type of bone marrow cancer. Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found at the centre of some bones. It produces the body's blood cells. Multiple myeloma affects the plasma cells (a type of blood cell) inside the bone marrow."
What are the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma?,"In the early stages, myeloma may not cause any symptoms. It's often only suspected or diagnosed after a routine blood or urine test."
When should someone speak to their doctor about multiple myeloma?,"Speak to your GP if you have any of these symptoms. While they're unlikely to be caused by cancer, it's best to get a proper diagnosis. Your GP will examine you to check for bone tenderness, bleeding, signs of infection, and any other symptoms that suggest you may have myeloma."
Who is affected by multiple myeloma?,"Multiple myeloma is an uncommon type of cancer. It's not known exactly what causes the condition, although it's more common in people with monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) and adults over 60 and black people."
How is multiple myeloma treated?,"There is currently no cure for multiple myeloma, but treatment can often help control it for several years. Treatment will often involve:  a combination of anti-myeloma medications to destroy the myeloma cells  medicines and procedures to prevent and treat problems caused by myeloma, such as bone pain, fractures and anaemia  anti-myeloma medicines to control the cancer when it comes back (relapses)."
What about Multiple sclerosis?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the brain and/or spinal cord. It can cause symptoms like problems with vision, arm or leg movement, sensation or balance."
What are the symptoms of multiple sclerosis?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause a wide range of symptoms and can affect any part of the body. It affects everyone differently. The symptoms are unpredictable. Some people's symptoms develop and worsen over time, while for others, they come and go."
What happens when someone has multiple sclerosis?,"MS is an autoimmune condition. This means your immune system mistakes part of your body for a foreign substance and attacks it. In the case of MS, it attacks the myelin sheath in the brain and/or spinal cord. This is the layer that surrounds your nerves, protecting them and helping electrical signals travel from the brain to the rest of the body."
What causes multiple sclerosis?,Exactly why someone develops multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't known. It's not caused by anything you've done and it's not clear if you can prevent it.
How is multiple sclerosis diagnosed?,It can be hard to tell if you have multiple sclerosis (MS) because some of the symptoms are like other conditions. You may need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms first.
What are the types of multiple sclerosis?,"Once you have a diagnosis of MS, your neurologist might be able to identify which type of MS you have - either relapsing remitting MS or primary progressive MS."
How is multiple sclerosis treated?,"Coming to terms with a long-term condition like MS can put a strain on you, your family and your friends. Be honest about how you feel and let your family and friends know what they can do to help."
What are mumps?,"Mumps is a contagious viral infection that used to be common in children before the introduction of the MMR vaccine. It’s most recognisable by the painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands), giving a person with mumps a distinctive ""hamster face"" appearance."
When should someone see their doctor about mumps?,"It's important to contact your GP if you suspect mumps so a diagnosis can be made. While mumps isn't usually serious, the condition has similar symptoms to more serious types of infection, such as glandular fever and tonsillitis."
Who is affected by mumps?,Most cases of mumps occur in people between 17 and 34 years of age who have not received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. There were 534 confirmed mumps cases of mumps in Scotland between 1 January and 30 September 2019.
How is mumps spread?,Mumps is spread in the same way as colds and flu – through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.
What are the preventive measures for mumps?,"You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they're given the combined MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella). The MMR vaccine is part of the routine NHS childhood immunisation schedule."
What is the treatment for mumps?,"There's currently no cure for mumps, but the infection should pass within one or two weeks."
What are the complications of mumps?,"Mumps usually passes without causing serious damage to a person's health. Serious complications are rare. However, mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain. Other complications include swelling of the testicles in males or the ovaries in females (if the affected male or female has gone through puberty)."
What about Meniere's disease?,"Ménière's disease is a rare disorder that affects the inner ear. It can cause vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of pressure deep inside the ear."
How does Meniere's disease progress?,"Ménière's disease often progresses through different stages. In the early stages, most people have sudden and unpredictable attacks of vertigo, accompanied by nausea, vomiting and dizziness."
Who is affected by Meniere's disease?,"It's estimated that around one in 1,000 people have Ménière's disease. Ménière's disease most commonly affects people aged 20-60 and it's thought to be slightly more common in women than men."
What causes Meniere's disease?,"The exact cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, but it's thought to be caused by a problem with pressure deep inside the ear. Factors that can increase your risk of developing Ménière's disease include a family history of the condition and a chemical imbalance in the fluid in your inner ear."
How is Meniere's disease treated?,"Treatments for Ménière’s disease can usually help people with the condition control their symptoms. However, current treatments aren't able to cure the condition."
What is myasthenia gravis?,"Myasthenia gravis is a long term (chronic) condition that causes muscle weakness and fatigue. It's a rare condition that commonly affects the muscles that control the eyes and eyelids. It can also affect the face, speaking, chewing, swallowing and other parts of the body."
What are the symptoms of myasthenia gravis?,"The first symptoms of myasthenia gravis are often droopy eyelids or double vision. It usually affects the eyes first and may spread to other parts of the body. It can take weeks, months or years for symptoms to develop in other parts of the body."
How is myasthenia gravis diagnosed?,It can be difficult to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Your doctor will ask about your medical history and symptoms. You might need several tests to rule out other causes of your symptoms before you can be diagnosed with myasthenia gravis.
What are the treatment options for myasthenia gravis?,"There are treatments available that can help reduce the affects of your symptoms. If your symptoms get worse following certain triggers, you should try to avoid those triggers as much as possible."
What are nasal and sinus cancer,"Nasal and sinus cancer affects the nasal cavity (the space behind your nose) and the sinuses (small, air-filled cavities inside your nose, cheekbones and forehead). It's a rare type of cancer that most often affects men aged 50 to 60."
What are the symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer?,"The most common symptoms of nasal and sinus cancer are a persistent blocked nose, which usually only affects 1 side and nosebleeds and mucus draining from the nose, which may be blood-stained and a decreased sense of smell. These symptoms can be similar to more common and less serious conditions, such as a cold or sinusitis."
When should someone speak to their doctor about nasal and sinus cancer?,"Speak to your GP if you notice any unusual or persistent symptoms. They're very unlikely to be caused by nasal or sinus cancer, but are worth getting checked out."
Who is at risk of nasal and sinus cancer?,"Several factors are known to increase the risk of developing nasal and sinus cancer, including: your gender (men are more likely to develop nasal and sinus cancer than women) - prolonged exposure to certain substances through your work, including wood dust, leather dust, nickel, chromium and formaldehyde - smoking(the more you smoke, the higher your risk of developing several types of cancer, including nasal and sinus cancer) - human papilloma virus (HPV)(a group of viruses that affect the skin and moist membranes, such as the mouth and throat)"
What are the treatments available for nasal and sinus cancer?,"The best treatment depends on several factors, including how far the cancer has spread and your general health. Treatment may include (surgery to remove a tumour, radiotherapy, chemotherapy)."
What is nasopharyngeal cancer?,Nasopharyngeal cancer is a rare type of cancer that affects the part of the throat connecting the back of the nose to the back of the mouth (the pharynx).
What are the symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer?,"It's often difficult to recognise nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other, less serious conditions. Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage.Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer can include: a lump in the neck - hearing loss - tinnitus - rather than from an outside source  - a blocked or stuffy nose - nosebleeds."
What causes nasopharyngeal cancer?,"The exact cause of nasopharyngeal cancer is unknown, but a number of factors can increase your risk of developing the condition."
How is nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosed?,"If you see your GP with symptoms that could indicate nasopharyngeal cancer, they'll usually ask about your symptoms and carry out some examinations. This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light."
How is nasopharyngeal cancer treated?,"If you're diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, you'll be cared for by a team of different specialists who work together called a multidisciplinary team (MDT). Members of your MDT will discuss with you what they think the best treatment option is in your case."
What about Neuroblastoma of Children?,Most children who have neuroblastoma are younger than 5 years old. It's the most common solid tumour in children that occurs outside of the brain and makes up 8% of the total number of children’s cancers.
What are the causes of neuroblastoma in children?,"As with most cancers, the cause of neuroblastoma is unknown. It is not infectious and cannot be passed on to other people."
What are the signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma in children?,"The symptoms vary, depending on where your child’s neuroblastoma tumour is if the tumour is in the abdomen, your child’s tummy may be swollen and they may complain of constipation or have difficulty passing urine (peeing), if the tumour affects the chest area, your child may be breathless and have difficulty swallowing, if the tumour occurs in the neck, it’s often visible as a lump and occasionally affects breathing and swallowing, occasionally, there are deposits of neuroblastoma in the skin that appear as small, blue-coloured lumps, if the tumour is pressing on the spinal cord, children may have weakness in the legs and walk unsteadily – if your child is not yet walking, you may notice reduced leg movements; they may also have constipation or difficulty passing urine (peeing)"
How is neuroblastoma diagnosed?,"A variety of tests and investigations will be needed to diagnose neuroblastoma. These include a biopsy of the tumour, blood and bone marrow tests, X-rays, CT or MRI scans, and a special nuclear medicine scan called an MIBG scan. These tests are carried out to confirm the diagnosis of neuroblastoma, and to find the exact position of the original site of neuroblastoma within the body and to see whether it has spread. This process is known as staging."
What are the treatment options for neuroblastoma in children?,"The treatment of neuroblastoma depends on the age of the child, the size and position of the tumour, the tumour biology (including the MYCN status) and whether the neuroblastoma has spread."
What are neuroendocrine tumours? ,Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare tumours that can occur in the cells of the neuroendocrine system. The neuroendocrine system consists of nerve and gland cells. It produces hormones and releases them into the bloodstream.
What are the types of neuroendocrine tumors?,"Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP NETs) are tumours that develop in the gut or pancreas. Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI NETs) develop in the digestive system, which includes the bowel, stomach or oesophagus. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs) develop in the pancreas."
What are the symptoms of neuroendocrine tumors?,"The symptoms of a neuroendocrine tumour can vary depending on where it is and what hormones it produces. For example, a tumour in the digestive system may cause diarrhoea, constipation or tummy pains. A tumour in the lung may cause wheezing or a persistent cough."
What causes neuroendocrine tumors?,"What causes neuroendocrine tumours isn't fully understood. However, your chance of developing a NET is increased if you have one of the following rare conditions or syndromes (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), neurofibrmatosis type 1, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) )"
How are neuroendocrine tumors diagnosed?,"There are many tests that can be used to diagnose NETs, including blood tests, urine tests, scans, and a biopsy (where a small tissue sample is taken for closer examination)."
How are neuroendocrine tumors treated?,"How a neuroendocrine tumour is treated will depend on your individual circumstances. For example, your treatment will depend on: where the tumour is - how advanced your condition is - your overall health."
What about Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the term for a range of conditions caused by a build-up of fat in the liver. It's usually seen in people who are overweight or obese.
What are the stages of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,"NAFLD develops in 4 main stages. Most people will only ever develop the first stage, usually without realising it. In small number of cases it can progress and eventually lead to liver damage if not detected and managed. The main stages of NAFLD are: The main stages of NAFLD are: simple fatty liver (steatosis) - non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - fibrosis - cirrhosis"
Am I at risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,You're at an increased risk of NAFLD if you: are obese or overweight - fat around your waist  - have type 2 diabetes - have high blood pressure - have high cholesterol - are over the age of 50 - smoke.
What are the symptoms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,There aren't usually any symptoms of NAFLD in the early stages. You probably won't know you have it unless it's diagnosed during tests carried out for another reason.
How is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosed?,"NAFLD is often diagnosed after a blood test called a liver function test produces an abnormal result and other liver conditions, such as hepatitis, are ruled out. However, blood tests don't always pick up NAFLD."
What are the treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease?,"Most people with NAFLD won't develop any serious problems, but if you're diagnosed with the condition it's a good idea to take steps to stop it getting any worse. There's currently no specific medication for NAFLD, but making healthy lifestyle choices can help and treatment may be recommended for associated conditions (high blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol) or complications."
What about non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout your body."
Who is affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age, but your chances of developing the condition increase as you get older, with most cases diagnosed in people over 65. Slightly more men than women are affected."
What causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"The exact cause of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is unknown. However, your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a medical condition that weakens your immune system or you take immunosuppressant medication or you have previously been exposed to a common virus called the Epstein-Barr virus"
How is non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed?,The only way to confirm a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is by carrying out a biopsy. This is a minor surgical procedure where a sample of affected lymph node tissue is removed and studied in a laboratory.
What are the treatment options for non-Hodgkin lymphoma?,"The main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a type of targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy"
What is the introduction of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Children?,"Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer. It's more common in boys than girls. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past."
What are the causes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children?,We don’t know what causes NHL but there is research going on all the time to try to find out. It's important to remember that nothing you have done has caused the cancer.
What are the signs and symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children?,"The first sign of NHL is usually a lump somewhere in the body, which is caused by swollen lymph nodes. This can cause different symptoms, depending on where the swollen lymph nodes are. If glands in the abdomen are affected, this may cause a feeling of being full after meals and some stomach pain. Other symptoms of NHL include a high temperature (fever), tiredness, weight loss, and loss of appetite. In a few children, lymphoma cells may be found in the bone marrow or in the fluid around the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid)."
How is non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children diagnosed?,"A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose NHL. Part, or all, of a swollen lymph gland, may be removed so that the cells can be examined in the laboratory (biopsy). This involves a small operation that is usually done under a general anaesthetic. Tests such as X-rays, ultrasound scans, MRI scans, CT scans, blood tests and bone marrow samples may be carried out to find out the extent of the disease. This is known as staging."
What are the treatment options for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in children?,Treatment for NHL has a very good success rate and many people are cured. Chemotherapy is the most important treatment for children with NHL. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer (cytotoxic) drugs to destroy cancer cells.
What is Norovirus?,"Norovirus causes diarrhoea and vomiting and is one of the most common stomach bugs. It's also called the 'winter vomiting bug' because it's more common in winter, although you can catch it at any time of the year. Norovirus can be very unpleasant but usually clears up by itself in a few days."
What are the symptoms of norovirus?,"You're likely to have norovirus if you experience: suddenly feeling sick, projectile vomiting or watery diarrhoea. Some people also have a slight fever, headaches, painful stomach cramps and aching limbs."
How is norovirus spread?,"Norovirus spreads very easily in public places such as hospitals, nursing homes and schools. Norovirus is most infectious from the start of symptoms until 48 hours after all symptoms have stopped. You may also be infectious for a short time before and after this."
What are the preventive measures for norovirus?,"It's not always possible to avoid getting norovirus, but following the advicecan help stop the virus spreading. You should stay off work or school until at least 48 hours after the norovirus symptoms have stopped, avoid visiting anyone in hospital during this time, wash your hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water particularly after using the toilet and before preparing or handling food and be aware alcohol-based hand gels don't kill the virus."
What should someone do if they have norovirus?,"If you experience sudden diarrhoea and/or vomiting, the best thing to do is to stay at home until you're feeling better. There's no treatment for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course."
When should someone seek medical advice for norovirus?,"You don't normally need to see your GP if you think you or your child has norovirus, as there's no specific treatment for it. Antibiotics won't help because norovirus is caused by a virus."
What are nosebleeds?,"Nosebleeds can be frightening, but they aren't usually a sign of anything serious and can often be treated at home. The medical name for a nosebleed is epistaxis."
What should someone do in the case of nosebleeds?,"To stop a nosebleed, sit down and firmly pinch the soft part of your nose, just above your nostrils, for at least 10 to 15 minutes, lean forward and breathe through your mouth , place an ice pack or bag of frozen vegetables covered by a towel on the bridge of your nose, stay upright, rather than lying down, as this reduces the blood pressure in the blood vessels of your nose and will discourage further bleeding."
What causes nosebleeds?,"The inside of your nose is full of tiny, delicate blood vessels that can become damaged and bleed relatively easily. Common causes of nosebleeds include: picking your nose - blowing your nose very hard - a minor injury to your nose."
Who is prone to nosebleeds?,"Nosebleeds are fairly common and most people will experience them every now and again. Anyone can get a nosebleed, but they most often affect: children between 2 and 10 years of age, elderly people, pregnant women, people who take blood thinning medication such as aspirin or anticoagulants, such as warfarin, people with blood clotting disorders, such as haemophilia."
Are nosebleeds considered serious?,"Nosebleeds aren't usually serious. However, frequent or heavy nosebleeds may indicate more serious health problems, such as high blood pressure or a blood clotting disorder, and should be checked."
How can nosebleeds be prevented?,Talk to your GP if you experience nosebleeds frequently and aren't able to prevent them. They may refer you to an ENT specialist for an assessment.
What is obesity,"The term 'obese' describes a person who's very overweight, with a lot of body fat."
How is obesity defined?,"There are many ways in which a person's health in relation to their weight can be classified, but the most widely used method is body mass index (BMI)."
What are the risks associated with obesity?,"It's very important to take steps to tackle obesity because, as well as causing obvious physical changes, it can lead to a number of serious and potentially life-threatening conditions, such as: type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer, stroke."
What are the causes of obesity?,Obesity is generally caused by consuming more calories – particularly those in fatty and sugary foods – than you burn off through physical activity. The excess energy is stored by the body as fat.
What are the treatment options for obesity?,"The best way to treat obesity is to eat a healthy, reduced-calorie diet and exercise regularly.  You may also benefit from receiving psychological support from a trained healthcare professional to help change the way you think about food and eating."
What are some other obesity-related problems?,"Obesity can cause a number of further problems, including difficulties with daily activities and serious health conditions. Day-to-day problems related to obesity include: breathlessness - increased sweating - snoring - difficulty doing physical activity - often feeling very tired - joint and back pain - low confidence and self-esteem - feeling isolated."
What is the introduction of Obsessive compulsive disorder?,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive activity. An obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters a person's mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease."
What causes Obsessive compulsive disorder?,"It's not clear exactly what causes OCD, although a number of factors have been suggested. In some cases the condition may run in families, and may be linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain's development."
Who is affected by Obsessive compulsive disorder?,"OCD affects men, women and children. The condition typically first starts to significantly interfere with a person's life during early adulthood, although problems can develop at any age."
How can one get help for Obsessive compulsive disorder?,"People with OCD are often reluctant to seek help because they feel ashamed or embarrassed. However, if you have OCD, there is nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about. It is a long-term health condition like diabetes or asthma, and it is not your fault you have it."
How is Obsessive compulsive disorder treated?,"With treatment, the outlook for OCD is good. Many people will eventually be cured of their OCD, or their symptoms will at least be reduced enough that they can enjoy a good quality of life."
What is obstructive sleep apnoea?,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a relatively common condition where the walls of the throat relax and narrow during sleep, interrupting normal breathing."
what are Apnoea and hypopnoea?,"There are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA: apnoea , hypopnoea . People with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea throughout the night. These events may occur around once every one or two minutes in severe cases."
What are the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea?,"The symptoms of OSA are often first spotted by a partner, friend or family member who notices problems while you sleep. Signs of OSA in someone sleeping can include: loud snoring, noisy and laboured breathing and repeated short periods where breathing is interrupted by gasping or snorting."
When should one seek medical advice for obstructive sleep apnoea?,See your GP if you think you might have OSA. They can check for other possible reasons for your symptoms and can arrange for an assessment of your sleep to be carried out through a local sleep centre.
What are the causes of obstructive sleep apnoea?,It's normal for the muscles and soft tissues in the throat to relax and collapse to some degree while sleeping. For most people this doesn't cause breathing problems.
How is obstructive sleep apnoea treated?,"OSA is a treatable condition, and there are a variety of treatment options that can reduce the symptoms. Treatment options for OSA include: lifestyle changes, using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device and wearing a mandibular advancement device (MAD)."
What are the complications of obstructive sleep apnoea?,"The treatments mentioned above can often help control the symptoms of OSA, although treatment will need to be lifelong in most cases. If OSA is left untreated, it can have a significant impact on your quality of life, causing problems such as poor performance at work and school, and placing a strain on your relationships with others."
How can obstructive sleep apnoea be prevented?,"It's not always possible to prevent OSA, but making certain lifestyle changes may reduce your risk of developing the condition."
What is oesophageal cancer?,Oesophageal cancer is a type of cancer affecting the oesophagus (gullet) – the long tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach.
What are the symptoms of oesophageal cancer?,"Oesophageal cancer doesn't usually cause any symptoms in the early stages when the tumour is small. It's only when it gets bigger that symptoms tend to develop. Symptoms of oesophageal cancer can include: difficulty swallowing - persistent indigestion or heartburn - bringing up food soon after eating - loss of appetite and weight loss - pain or discomfort in your upper tummy, chest or back."
When should one seek medical advice for oesophageal cancer?,"Speak to your GP if you experience: swallowing difficulties, heartburn on most days for three weeks or more and any other unusual or persistent symptoms ."
What are the causes of oesophageal cancer?,"The exact cause of oesophageal cancer is unknown, but the following things can increase your risk: persistent gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), smoking, drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time, being overweight or obese and having an unhealthy diet that's low in fruit and vegetables."
What are the treatments available for oesophageal cancer?,"If oesophageal cancer is diagnosed at an early stage, it may be possible to cure it with: surgery to remove the affected section of oesophagus and chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy (chemoradiation), to kill the cancerous cells and shrink the tumour."
What is oral thrush in adults?,Oral thrush is a fungal infection of the mouth. It is not contagious and is usually successfully treated with antifungal medication.
What are the symptoms of oral thrush in adults?,"Symptoms of oral thrush can include: white patches (plaques) in the mouth that can often be wiped off, leaving behind red areas that may bleed slightly, loss of taste or an unpleasant taste in the mouth, redness inside the mouth and throat, cracks at the corners of the mouth and a painful, burning sensation in the mouth."
What causes oral thrush?,"Low numbers of the fungus Candida are naturally found in the mouth and digestive system of most people. They don't usually cause any problems, but can lead to oral thrush if they multiply."
How is oral thrush treated?,"Oral thrush can usually be successfully treated with antifungal medicines. These usually come in the form of gels or liquid that you apply directly inside your mouth (topical medication), although tablets or capsules are sometimes used."
How can oral thrush be prevented?,"If you have a condition or are receiving treatment that could put you at a high risk of developing oral thrush, your doctor may recommend taking a course of antifungal medication to prevent this happening."
What about osteoarthritis?,"Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes the joints to become painful and stiff. It is the most common type of arthritis. The severity of osteoarthritis symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and between different affected joints. For some people, the symptoms may be mild and may come and go, whereas others can experience more continuous and severe problems."
When should one seek medical advice about osteoarthritis?,"You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis so they can try to identify the cause. To help determine whether you have osteoarthritis, your GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your joints."
What causes osteoarthritis?,"Osteoarthritis occurs when there is damage in and around the joints that the body cannot fully repair. It's not clear exactly why this happens in some people, although your chances of developing the condition can be influenced by a number of factors, such as your age and weight."
How can osteoarthritis be managed?,"Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition and can't be cured, but it doesn't necessarily get any worse over time and it can sometimes gradually improve. A number of treatments are also available to reduce the symptoms."
What is it like living with osteoarthritis?,"As osteoarthritis is a long-term condition, it is important you get the right support to help you cope with any issues such as reduced mobility and advice on any necessary financial support."
What about osteoporosis?,"Osteoporosis is a condition that weakens bones, making them fragile and more likely to break. It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture."
Who is affected by osteoporosis?,"More than 500,000 people receive hospital treatment for fragility fractures (fractures that occur from standing height or less) every year as a result of osteoporosis."
What are the causes of osteoporosis?,"Losing bone is a normal part of the ageing process, but some people lose bone density much faster than normal. This can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures."
How is osteoporosis diagnosed using risk assessment tools?,"If your doctor suspects you have osteoporosis, they can make an assessment using an online programme. These tools help to predict a person's risk of fracture between the ages of 40 and 90. The algorithms used give a 10-year probability of hip fracture and a 10-year probability of a major fracture in the spine, hip, shoulder or forearm."
How is osteoporosis diagnosed using a DEXA scan?,"They may also refer you for a DEXA (DXA) scan to measure your bone mineral density. It's a short, painless procedure that takes about five minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned."
What is osteopenia?,"You may be diagnosed with osteopenia if bone density tests show you have decreased bone density, but not enough to be classed as osteoporosis."
How is osteoporosis treated?,"Treatment for osteoporosis is based on treating and preventing fractures, and using medication to strengthen bones. The decision about whether you need treatment depends on your risk of fracture. This will be based on a number of factors such as your age, sex and the results of your DEXA scan."
How can osteoporosis be prevented?,"If you're at risk of developing osteoporosis, you should take steps to help keep your bones healthy. This may include: taking regular exercise, healthy eating and making lifestyle changes."
How can someone live well with osteoporosis?,"If you're diagnosed with osteoporosis, there are steps you can take to reduce your chances of a fall, such as removing hazards from your home and having regular sight tests and hearing tests."
What is the introduction of Osteosarcoma?,"Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer. Osteosarcomas occur more commonly in older children and teenagers and are very rarely seen in children under 5. More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments. But it remains devastating to hear that your child has cancer, and at times it can feel overwhelming. There are many healthcare professionals and support organisations to help you through this difficult time."
What causes Osteosarcoma?,"There has been a lot of research into the causes of osteosarcoma but, like most childhood cancers, a definite cause is unknown. There are a few risk factors that have been associated with osteosarcoma. Children who have hereditary retinoblastoma (a rare tumour of the eye) have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. Children who have previously had radiotherapy and chemotherapy also have an increased risk of developing osteosarcoma. It is not caused by injuries or damage to the bone, although an injury may draw attention to a bone tumour."
What are the signs and symptoms of Osteosarcoma?,"Pain in the affected bone is the most common symptom. This pain may initially come and go, and then gradually become more severe and constant especially at night. There may also be swelling around the affected bone. Osteosarcoma is sometimes discovered when a bone that has been weakened by cancer breaks after the person has had a minor fall or accident. Some patients may develop a limp if the tumour is in the leg or pelvis."
How is Osteosarcoma diagnosed?,"Usually you begin by seeing your GP, who will examine your child and may arrange tests or X-rays. If a bone tumour is suspected, the doctor will refer your child directly to a specialist hospital or bone tumour centre for further tests."
What are the treatment options for Osteosarcoma?,"Treatment will depend on a number of factors including the size, position, and stage of the tumour."
What about otitis externa?,"Otitis externa is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) of the external ear canal, which is the tube between the outer ear and eardrum."
What are the symptoms of otitis externa?,"Symptoms of otitis externa include: ear pain, which can be severe, itchiness in the ear canal, a discharge of liquid or pus from the ear, some degree of temporary hearing loss."
When should one see a doctor about otitis externa?,"Your GP will ask about your symptoms and whether you regularly use any items that are inserted into your ears, such as hearing aids or ear plugs. They may also examine inside your ear using an instrument called an otoscope."
What causes otitis externa?,"Most cases of otitis externa are caused by a bacterial infection, although the condition can also be caused by: irritation - fungal infections - allergies."
Who is affected by otitis externa?,Otitis externa is relatively common. It's estimated that around 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their lives. The condition is slightly more common in women than men and is most often diagnosed in adults 45 to 75 years of age.
How is otitis externa treated?,"Otitis externa sometimes gets better without treatment, but it can take several weeks. Your GP can prescribe ear drop medication that usually improves the symptoms within a few days."
How can otitis externa be prevented?,"To help reduce your chances of developing otitis externa, you should avoid inserting cotton wool buds and other things into your ears (including your fingers), as this can damage the sensitive skin in your ear canal."
What are the complications of otitis externa?,"Complications of otitis externa are uncommon, but some can be very serious. One rare complication of otitis externa is necrotising otitis externa, which is where an infection spreads from the ear canal into the surrounding bone."
What is ovarian cancer?,Ovarian cancer is most common in women and anyone with ovaries who has been through the menopause (usually over the age of 50). It can affect women and anyone with ovaries of any age.
What are the symptoms of ovarian cancer?,"As the symptoms of ovarian cancer can be similar to those of other conditions, it can be difficult to recognise. However, there are early symptoms to look out for, such as persistent bloating, pain in the pelvis and lower stomach, and difficulty eating."
What causes ovarian cancer?,"The exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain things are thought to increase a woman's risk of developing the condition, such as age, the number of eggs the ovaries release and whether someone in your family has had ovarian or breast cancer in the past. However, only 1 in 10 cases of ovarian cancer has a genetic link."
How is ovarian cancer treated?,"The treatment you receive for ovarian cancer will depend on several things, including the stage of your cancer and your general health. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for ovarian cancer, but your treatment will usually involve a combination of surgery and chemotherapy."
What is ovarian cancer screening?,"There are methods of screening for ovarian cancer but, currently, they haven't been fully tested. Screening is only available for women and anyone with ovaries who are at high risk of developing the condition due to a strong family history or inheritance of a particular faulty gene. Clinical trials in the UK are currently being carried out to assess the effectiveness of screening in high-risk groups and in the general population. A cervical screening test, which used to be called a smear test, can't detect ovarian cancer."
What is the introduction of Ovarian cancer in teenagers and young adults?,"Ovarian cancer starts in the ovaries, which are part of the reproductive system. This is in the lower part of your tummy (abdomen), in the area between your hips (called the pelvis). Your reproductive system is made up of your vagina and the organs involved in getting pregnant and having a baby."
What is the reproductive system of Ovarian cancer in teenagers and young adults?,"Your reproductive system is made up of the vagina, cervix, womb (also called uterus), fallopian tubes, ovaries."
What are the facts about ovaries?,You have 2 ovaries – 1 on each side of your womb. They’re about 4cm long. At puberty your ovaries start making hormones called oestrogen and progesterone. These cause your breasts to grow and your periods to start.
What are the types of ovarian cancer?,"There are 3 types of ovarian cancer: epithelial tumours, germ cell tumours and stromal cell tumours. Teenagers are mostly affected by the germ cell tumour type. You may hear your type of germ cell tumour being called: dysgerminoma, teratoma, yolk sac tumour."
What is ovarian cysts?,An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that develops on an ovary. They are very common and do not usually cause any symptoms. Most ovarian cysts occur as part of the normal workings of the ovaries. These cysts are generally harmless and disappear without treatment in a few months.
What are the signs and symptoms of ovarian cysts?,"An ovarian cyst will usually only cause symptoms if it splits (ruptures), is very large, or it blocks the blood supply to the ovaries. In these cases, you may have pelvic pain, pain during sex, difficulty emptying your bowels, a frequent need to urinate ,heavy periods, irregular periods or lighter periods than normal, bloating and a swollen tummy, feeling very full after only eating a little and difficulty getting pregnant (although fertility is mostly unaffected by ovarian cysts)."
What is the function of the ovaries?,"The ovaries are two small, bean-shaped organs that are part of the female reproductive system. A woman has two ovaries – one each side of the womb (uterus)."
What are the types of ovarian cysts?,The two main types of ovarian are:  functional ovarian cysts(cysts that develop as part of the menstrual cycle and are usually harmless and short-lived; these are the most common type of ovarian cyst) and pathological ovarian cysts (cysts that occur due to abnormal cell growth; these are much less common).
How are ovarian cysts diagnosed?,"If your GP thinks you may have an ovarian cyst, you'll probably be referred for an ultrasound scan, carried out by using a probe placed inside your vagina. If a cyst is identified during the ultrasound scan, you may need to have this monitored with a repeat ultrasound scan in a few weeks, or your GP may refer you to a gynaecologist (a doctor who specialises in female reproductive health)."
How are ovarian cysts treated?,Whether an ovarian cyst needs to be treated will depend on its size and appearance or whether you have any symptoms or whether you have been through the menopause.
What about overactive thyroids?,Overactive thyroid (also known as hyperthyroidism) is a relatively common hormonal condition that occurs when there is too much thyroid hormone in the body.
What are the symptoms of overactive thyroids?,"Excess levels of thyroid hormones can then speed up the body’s metabolism, triggering a range of symptoms, such as: nervousness and anxiety, hyperactivity, unexplained or unplanned weight loss and swelling of the thyroid gland, which causes a noticeable lump, known as a goitre, to form in the throat."
What causes an overactive thyroid gland?,The thyroid gland is found in the neck. It produces hormones that are released into the bloodstream to control the body's growth and metabolism. These hormones are called thyroxine and triiodothyronine.
How is overactive thyroids treated?,"An overactive thyroid usually responds well to treatment, and most people are able to control their symptoms. The three most widely used treatments for an overactive thyroid gland are: thionamides ,radioiodine treatment ,surgery ."
What are the complications of overactive thyroids?,"Around 1 in 20 people with Graves' disease will also develop symptoms affecting their eyes, such as: double vision, sensitivity to light (photophobia), tearing (excess production of tears). This is known as Graves' ophthalmopathy and should be seen by a doctor who specialises in treating eye conditions (an ophthalmologist)."
Who is affected by overactive thyroids?,"Women are 10 times more likely to have an overactive thyroid gland than men.It is estimated that around 1 in 50 women in England currently live with an overactive thyroid gland. In most cases, symptoms will begin somewhere between the ages of 20 and 40, though they can start at any age, including in childhood."
What about Paget's disease of the nipple?,"Paget’s disease of the nipple, also known as Paget’s disease of the breast, is a rare type of breast cancer."
What are the symptoms of Paget's disease of the nipple?,"Paget's disease usually affects the skin of one nipple and produces eczema-like symptoms, appearing as an itchy, red rash on the nipple that can extend to the darker area of surrounding skin (the areola)."
What causes Paget's disease?,"Paget’s disease is usually a sign of breast cancer in tissue behind the nipple, or breast tissue away from the nipple. The breast cancer can either be: invasive, non-invasive ."
How is Paget's disease diagnosed?,"You should visit your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola (the darker area of skin around the nipple). As Paget’s disease is a form of breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be."
How is Paget's disease treated?,"Surgery is usually the first line of treatment but unlike other forms of breast cancer, it involves removing breast tissue that includes the nipple and areola. This may be followed by a combination of: chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological or hormone therapy"
How can Paget's disease prevented?,"Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing alcohol intake and regular exercise, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, these factors remain controversial."
What is the Risk factors for breast cancer?,"There are a number of factors that can increase your risk of developing breast cancer. These include: age, family history, previously being diagnosed with breast cancer, previously having a benign breast lump, being overweight, alcohol."
What is pancreatic cancer?,Pancreatic cancer is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas – a large gland that's part of the digestive system.
What are the symptoms of pancreatic cancer?,"In the early stages, a tumour in the pancreas doesn't usually cause any symptoms, which can make it difficult to diagnose. It's important to remember that these symptoms can be caused by many different conditions, and aren't usually the result of cancer. But you should contact your GP if you're concerned, or if these symptoms start suddenly."
What are the causes of pancreatic cancer?,"It's not fully understood what causes pancreatic cancer, but a number of risk factors for developing the condition have been identified."
How is pancreatic cancer diagnosed?,Your GP will first ask about your general health and carry out a physical examination. They may examine your tummy (abdomen) for a lump and to see whether your liver is enlarged. They'll also check your skin and eyes for signs of jaundice and may request a urine sample and blood test.
How is pancreatic cancer treated?,"Cancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat. It rarely causes any symptoms in the early stages, so it's often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. If the tumour is large, treating the cancer will be more difficult."
How does one recover from surgery for pancreatic cancer?,"Recovering from pancreatic cancer surgery can be a long and difficult process. You'll probably experience some pain after your operation. The staff at your hospital will make sure you have adequate pain relief. After any type of surgery to your digestive system, your bowel will temporarily stop working. This means you won't be able to eat or drink straight away."
What is panic disorder?,"Panic disorder is where you have recurring and regular panic attacks, often for no apparent reason. Everyone experiences feelings of anxiety and panic at certain times during their lifetime. It's a natural response to stressful or dangerous situations."
What is anxiety?,"Anxiety is a feeling of unease. It can range from mild to severe and can include feelings of worry and fear. There are several conditions that can cause severe anxiety including phobias, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), post-traumatic stress disorder."
What are panic attacks?,A panic attack occurs when your body experiences a rush of intense psychological (mental) and physical symptoms.
What causes panic disorder?,"As with many mental health conditions, the exact cause of panic disorder isn't fully understood. However, it's thought the condition is probably linked to a combination of physical and psychological factors."
How is panic disorder diagnosed?,See your GP if you have symptoms of anxiety or panic disorder (see above). You may be diagnosed with panic disorder if you experience recurrent and unexpected panic attacks followed by at least one month of continuous worry or concern about having further attacks.
How is panic disorder treated?,The aim of treating panic disorder is to reduce the number of panic attacks you have and ease the severity of your symptoms. Psychological therapy and medication are the two main types of treatment for panic disorder.
What are the complications of panic disorder?,"Panic disorder is treatable, but to make a full recovery it's important that you seek medical help as soon as possible. Treatment for panic disorder is much more effective if it's given at an early stage."
What is Parkinson's disease?,Parkinson's disease is a condition in which parts of the brain become progressively damaged over many years.
What are the symptoms of Parkinson's disease?,"The three main symptoms of Parkinson's disease are: involuntary shaking of particular parts of the body (tremor), slow movement and stiff and inflexible muscles."
When should someone seek medical advice for Parkinson's disease?,See your GP if you're concerned that you may have symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Your GP will ask about the problems you're experiencing and may refer you to a specialist for further tests.
What are the causes of Parkinson's disease?,Parkinson's disease is caused by a loss of nerve cells in part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a reduction in a chemical called dopamine in the brain.
Who is affected by Parkinson's disease?,"Most people with Parkinson's start to develop symptoms when they're over 50, although around 1 in 20 people with the condition first experience symptoms when they're under 40. Men are slightly more likely to get Parkinson's disease than women."
How is Parkinson's disease treated?,"Although there's currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatments are available to help reduce the main symptoms and maintain quality of life for as long as possible."
What is Pelvic inflammatory disease?,"Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of the female upper genital tract, including the womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries."
How do you get pelvic inflammatory disease?,Most cases of PID are caused by an infection in the vagina or the neck of the womb (cervix) that has spread higher up. Many different types of bacteria can cause PID. However most cases are the result of a chlamydia or gonorrhoea infection.
What are the symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease?,"The symptoms of PID are fairly general, which means it can be difficult to diagnose. The symptoms may include: pain around the pelvis or lower abdomen, discomfort or pain during sex that is felt deep inside the pelvis, bleeding between periods or after sex, unusual vaginal discharge, fever and vomiting, pain in the rectum (back passage)."
How is pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosed?,"If you think you have PID you can make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services. There is no single test for diagnosing PID. Your doctor will diagnose PID based on your symptoms and an examination, as well as tests."
What are the treatment options for pelvic inflammatory disease?,"If it's diagnosed at an early stage, PID can be treated quickly and efficiently with antibiotics. You will probably be given antibiotics to take by mouth for at least 2 weeks."
How can the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease be reduced?,The most effective way to prevent PID is to protect yourself from sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
What is pelvic organ prolapse?,"Pelvic organ prolapse is bulging of one or more of the pelvic organs into the vagina. These organs are the uterus, vagina, bowel and bladder."
What are the symptoms of pelvic organ prolapse?,"Symptoms may include: a sensation of a bulge or something coming down or out of the vagina, which sometimes needs to be pushed back, discomfort during sex and problems passing urine."
When should I see my doctor about pelvic organ prolapse?,"Pelvic organ prolapse isn't life-threatening, but it can affect your quality of life. See your GP if you have any of the symptoms of a prolapse, or if you notice a lump in or around your vagina."
What are the types of prolapse?,"If pelvic organ prolapse is confirmed, it will usually be staged to indicate how severe it is. Most often, a number system is used, ranging from one to four, with four indicating a severe prolapse. Pelvic organ prolapse can affect the front, top or back of the vagina. The main types of prolapse are: anterior prolapse (cystocele) and prolapse of the uterus and cervix or top of the vagina and posterior wall prolapse (rectocoele or enterocoele)."
Why does prolapse happen?,"Prolapse is caused by weakening of tissues that support the pelvic organs. Although there's rarely a single cause, the risk of developing pelvic organ prolapse can be increased by: your age, changes caused by the menopause, being overweight, obese or having large fibroids (non-cancerous tumours in or around the womb) or pelvic cysts, repeated heavy lifting and manual work, long-term coughing or sneezing, excessive straining when going to the toilet because of long-term constipation."
Can a prolapse be prevented?,"There are several things you can do to reduce your risk of prolapse, including: doing regular pelvic floor exercises, maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight if you're overweight, eating a high-fibre diet with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain bread and cereal to avoid constipation and straining when going to the toilet, avoiding heavy lifting"
How is prolapse treated?,"Many women with prolapse don't need treatment, as the problem doesn't seriously interfere with their normal activities. Lifestyle changes such as weight loss and pelvic floor exercises are usually recommended in mild cases."
What is penile cancer?,"Penile cancer is a rare type of cancer that occurs on the skin of the penis or within the penis. Over the last 30 years, the number of penile cancer cases has increased by more than 20%, possibly due to changes in sexual practices."
What are the signs and symptoms of penile cancer?,"You should be aware of any abnormalities or signs of penile cancer, including: a growth or sore on the penis that doesn't heal within 4 weeks, bleeding from the penis or from under the foreskin, a foul-smelling discharge, thickening of the skin of the penis or foreskin that makes it difficult to draw back the foreskin (phimosis), a change in the colour of the skin of the penis or foreskin and a rash on the penis."
What are the types of penile cancer?,"The penis is made up of many different types of tissue. The type of penile cancer you have will depend on the type of cell the cancer developed from. The most common types of penile cancer include: squamous cell penile cancer, carcinoma in situ (CIS), adenocarcinoma, melanoma of the penis."
What causes penile cancer?,"The cause of penile cancer isn't known, but certain risk factors can increase your chances of getting it. Men who carry the human papilloma virus (HPV) have an increased risk of developing penile cancer, which is the virus that causes genital warts."
How is penile cancer diagnosed?,Your GP will ask you about any symptoms you have and when they occur. They'll also examine your penis for signs of penile cancer.
How is penile cancer treated?,"Treatment for penile cancer will depend on the size of the affected area and the rate at which the cancer has spread. For example, in most cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS), where only the skin cells of the penis are affected, treatment will usually involve either using a chemotherapy cream or having laser surgery to remove the affected area of skin. You will usually have a skin graft after surgery. The main treatments for penile cancer that isn't at a very early stage are: surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy."
How can penile cancer be prevented?,"It isn't always possible to prevent penile cancer, but you can reduce your chances of getting it. One of the main ways you can reduce your chances of developing penile cancer is to give up smoking (if you smoke)."
What is peripheral neuropathy?,"Peripheral neuropathy develops when nerves in the body's extremities – such as the hands, feet and arms – are damaged. The symptoms depend on which nerves are affected."
What is the peripheral nervous system?,"The peripheral nervous system is the network of nerves that lie outside the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). It includes different types of nerves with their own specific functions, including: sensory nerves, motor nerves, autonomic nerves."
What are the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy?,"The main symptoms can include: numbness and tingling in the feet or hands, burning, stabbing or shooting pain in affected areas, loss of balance and co-ordination, muscle weakness, especially in the feet."
When should I see my doctor about peripheral neuropathy?,"It's recommended that people at highest risk of peripheral neuropathy, such as people with diabetes, have regular check-ups. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and may arrange some tests to help identify the underlying cause. You may be referred to a hospital to see a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the nervous system)."
What are the causes of peripheral neuropathy?,"Over time, the high blood sugar levels associated with diabetes can damage the nerves. This type of nerve damage is known as diabetic polyneuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy can also have a wide range of other causes. For example, it can be caused by: physical injury to the nerves, a viral infection such as shingles, a side effect of certain medications or drinking too much alcohol."
How is peripheral neuropathy treated?,"Treatment for peripheral neuropathy depends on the symptoms and underlying cause. Only some of the underlying causes of neuropathy can be treated. For example, if you have diabetes it may help to gain better control of your blood sugar level, stop smoking, and cut down on alcohol."
What are the complications of peripheral neuropathy?,"The outlook for peripheral neuropathy varies, depending on the underlying cause and which nerves have been damaged. Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time."
What is personality disorder?,"Personality disorders are conditions in which an individual differs significantly from an average person, in terms of how they think, perceive, feel or relate to others."
When and why do personality disorders occur?,"Personality disorders typically emerge in adolescence and continue into adulthood. They may be mild, moderate or severe, and people may have periods of ""remission"" where they function well."
What are the types of personality disorder?,"Several different types of personality disorder are recognised. They have been broadly grouped into one of three clusters – A, B or C – which are summarised below."
How many people are affected by personality disorder?,"Personality disorders are common mental health problems. In England, it is estimated that around 1 in 20 people has a personality disorder. However, many people have only mild conditions so only need help at times of stress (such as bereavement). Other people with more severe problems may need specialist help for longer periods."
What is pleurisy?,Pleurisy is inflammation of the sheet-like layers that cover the lungs (the pleura). The most common symptom of pleurisy is a sharp chest pain when breathing deeply. Sometimes the pain is also felt in the shoulder.
When should I see my doctor about pleurisy?,"Pleurisy can usually be diagnosed by studying your symptoms. Your GP can listen to your chest to check for the distinctive dry, crunching sound that suggests you may have pleurisy."
What causes pleurisy?,"Most cases are the result of a viral infection (such as the flu) or a bacterial infection (such as pneumonia). In rarer cases, pleurisy can be caused by conditions such as a blood clot blocking the flow of blood into the lungs (pulmonary embolism) or lung cancer."
How is pleurisy treated?,"Treatment for pleurisy depends on the underlying cause. For example, pleurisy caused by a viral infection will often resolve itself without treatment. However, pleurisy caused by a bacterial infection is usually treated with antibiotics, and people who are frail or already in poor health may be admitted to hospital."
What is pneumonia?,Pneumonia is swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both lungs. It's usually caused by a bacterial infection.
What are the symptoms of pneumonia?,"The symptoms of pneumonia can develop suddenly over 24 to 48 hours, or they may come on more slowly over several days. Common symptoms of pneumonia include: a cough - difficulty breathing - fever - feeling generally unwell - sweating and shivering - loss of appetite - chest pain."
Who is affected by pneumonia?,"Pneumonia can affect people of any age, but it's more common – and can be more serious – in certain groups of people, such as the very young or the elderly. People in these groups are more likely to need hospital treatment if they develop pneumonia."
What causes pneumonia?,"Pneumonia is usually the result of a pneumococcal infection, caused by bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae. Many different types of bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus, can also cause pneumonia, as well as viruses and, more rarely, fungi."
How is pneumonia diagnosed?,Your GP may be able to diagnose pneumonia by asking about your symptoms and examining your chest. Further tests may be needed in some cases.
How is pneumonia treated?,"Mild pneumonia can usually be treated at home by: getting plenty of rest, taking antibiotics and drinking plenty of fluids."
What are the complications of pneumonia?,"Complications of pneumonia are more common in young children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes. Possible complications of pneumonia include: pleurisy, a lung abscess, blood poisoning (septicaemia)."
How can pneumonia be prevented?,"Although most cases of pneumonia are bacterial and aren't passed on from one person to another, ensuring good standards of hygiene will help prevent germs spreading."
What is polymyalgia rheumatica?,"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a condition that causes pain, stiffness and inflammation in the muscles around the shoulders, neck and hips."
What are the symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica?,"The main symptom is muscle stiffness in the morning that lasts longer than 45 minutes. It may also cause other symptoms, including: high temperature (fever) and sweating, extreme tiredness (fatigue), loss of appetite, weight loss, depression."
What causes polymyalgia rheumatica?,"The cause of polymyalgia rheumatica is unknown, but a combination of genetic and environmental factors is thought to be responsible."
How is polymyalgia rheumatica treated?,"The main treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica is a coritcosteroid medication called prednisolone, which is used to help relieve the symptoms."
What is post-polio syndrome?,Post-polio syndrome is a slow progressive condition that affects some people that have had polio. It's not life threatening but it can cause problems in your ability to carry out daily activities.
What are the symptoms of post-polio syndrome?,The symptoms of post-polio syndrome include: muscle weakness - shrinking of the muscles (atrophy) - tight joints (contractures) - pain in muscles or joints - chronic fatigue including physical tiredness and brain fatigue - swallowing and speech problems - respiratory problems like breathlessness and sleep apnoea - cramps and muscle twitching - being sensitive to cold temperatures.
What causes post-polio syndrome?,Post-polio syndrome is caused by the polio virus. It only affects people who've had polio although it can take 15 - 40 years after the infection for it to develop. It's not known if there's anything that can be done to prevent it.
How is post-polio syndrome diagnosed?,"It can be difficult to diagnose post-polio syndrome. There are no specific tests for it, and it can be mistaken for other conditions."
How is post-polio syndrome treated?,"As there's no cure for post-polio syndrome, treatment will help you manage your symptoms and quality of life. It's likely you'll have a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals working together to care for you including: neurologists , respiratory specialists, physiotherapists, orthotists, psychologists , pain management specialists, occupational therapists."
What is post-traumatic stress disorder?,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events."
What are the causes of post-traumatic stress disorder?,"The type of events that can cause PTSD include: serious road accidents - violent personal assaults, such as sexual assault, mugging or robbery - prolonged sexual abuse, violence or severe neglect - witnessing violent deaths - military combat - being held hostage."
What is complex post-traumatic stress disorder?,Complex PTSD can cause similar symptoms to PTSD and may not develop until years after the event. It's often more severe if the trauma was experienced early in life as this can affect a child's development.
When should someone seek medical advice about post-traumatic stress disorder?,"It's normal to experience upsetting and confusing thoughts after a traumatic event, but most people improve naturally over a few weeks."
How is post-traumatic stress disorder treated?,"PTSD can be successfully treated, even when it develops many years after a traumatic event."
What is postnatal depression?,"Postnatal depression is a type of depression that many parents experience after having a baby. It's a common problem, affecting more than 1 in every 10 women within a year of giving birth. It can also affect fathers and partners, although this is less common."
What are the symptoms of postnatal depression?,"Many women feel a bit down, tearful or anxious in the first week after giving birth. This is often called the ""baby blues"" and is so common that it’s considered normal. The ""baby blues"" don’t last for more than two weeks after giving birth."
How can one get help for postnatal depression?,"Speak to your GP or health visitor if you think you may be depressed. Many health visitors have been trained to recognise postnatal depression and have techniques that can help. If they can't help, they'll know someone in your area who can."
What are the treatments for postnatal depression?,"Postnatal depression can be lonely, distressing and frightening, but support and effective treatments are available. These include: self-help, psychological therapy, antidepressants."
What causes postnatal depression?,"The cause of postnatal depression isn't completely clear. Some of the factors it has been associated with include: a history of mental health problems, particularly depression, earlier in life - a history of mental health problems during pregnancy - having no close family or friends to support you - a poor relationship with your partner - recent stressful life events, such as a bereavement - experiencing the ""baby blues""."
Can postnatal depression be prevented?,"Although there have been several studies into preventing postnatal depression, there is no evidence that there’s anything specific you can do to prevent the condition developing, apart from maintaining as healthy a lifestyle as you can for yourself."
What are pressure ulcers?,"Pressure ulcers are an injury that breaks down the skin and underlying tissue. They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure. They are sometimes known as ""bedsores"" or ""pressure sores""."
How do pressure ulcers develop?,Pressure ulcers can develop when a large amount of pressure is applied to an area of skin over a short period of time. They can also occur when less pressure is applied over a longer period of time.
Who is affected by pressure ulcers?,"People over 70 years old are particularly vulnerable to pressure ulcers, as they are more likely to have mobility problems and ageing skin."
How are pressure ulcers treated and prevented?,"Treatment for pressure ulcers includes the use of dressings, creams and gels designed to speed up the healing process and relieve pressure. Surgery is sometimes recommended for the most serious cases."
What is prostate cancer?,"Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have it for many years. Symptoms often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis)."
What is the prostate?,"The prostate is a small gland in the pelvis. About the size of a satsuma, it's located between the penis and the bladder and surrounds the urethra."
Why does prostate cancer happen?,"The causes of prostate cancer are largely unknown. However, certain things can increase your risk of developing the condition."
What tests are available for prostate cancer?,"There is no single test for prostate cancer. All the tests used to help diagnose the condition have benefits and risks, which your doctor should discuss with you."
How is prostate cancer treated?,"In many cases, treatment is not immediately necessary. If the cancer is at an early stage and not causing symptoms, a policy of 'watchful waiting' or 'active surveillance' may be adopted. This involves carefully monitoring your condition."
How do people live with prostate cancer?,"As prostate cancer usually progresses very slowly, you can live for decades without symptoms or needing treatment. Nevertheless, it can have an effect on your life. As well as causing physical problems such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, a diagnosis of prostate cancer can understandably make you feel anxious or depressed."
What is psoriasis?,"Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes red, flaky, crusty patches of skin covered with silvery scales. These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore."
Why does psoriasis happen?,"People with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells. Skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only lasts about 3 to 7 days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis."
How is psoriasis diagnosed?,"A GP can often diagnose psoriasis based on the appearance of your skin. In rare cases, a small sample of skin, called a biopsy, will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. This determines the exact type of psoriasis and rules out other skin disorders, such as seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen planus, lichen simplex and pityriasis rosea."
How is psoriasis treated?,"There's no cure for psoriasis, but a range of treatments can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches. In most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or topical corticosteroids. Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin."
How do people live with psoriasis?,"Although psoriasis is just a minor irritation for some people, it can have a significant impact on quality of life for those more severely affected."
What is psoriatic arthritis?,"Psoriatic arthritis is a type of arthritis that develops in some people with the skin condition psoriasis. It typically causes affected joints to become inflamed (swollen), stiff and painful."
What are the signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?,"The pain, swelling and stiffness associated with psoriatic arthritis can affect any joint in the body. Symptoms usually develop slowly meaning that many people are unaware that they are developing psoriatic arthritis. In rarer cases, symptoms can develop suddenly and without warning."
How is psoriatic arthritis diagnosed?,"If your doctor thinks you may have arthritis, they should refer you to a rheumatologist (a specialist in joint conditions) for an assessment."
How is psoriatic arthritis treated?,"The main aims of treatment will be to relieve your symptoms, slow the progression of the condition and improve your quality of life.  For most people, this will involve trying a number of different medications, some of which can also treat the psoriasis. Ideally, you should take one medication to treat both your psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis whenever possible."
What is psychosis?,Psychosis is a mental health problem that causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. This might involve hallucinations or delusions.
What are the symptoms of psychosis?,"The two main symptoms of psychosis are: hallucinations (where a person hears, sees and, in some cases, feels, smells or tastes things that aren't there; a common hallucination is hearing voices) and delusions ( where a person believes things that, when examined rationally, are obviously untrue – for example, thinking your next door neighbour is planning to kill you )."
What causes psychosis?,"Psychosis isn't a condition in itself – it's triggered by other conditions. It's sometimes possible to identify the cause of psychosis as a specific mental health condition, such as: schizophrenia , bipolar disorder, severe depression."
How is psychosis diagnosed?,You should see your GP immediately if you're experiencing psychotic episodes. It's important psychosis is treated as soon as possible as early treatment usually has better long-term outcomes.
How is psychosis treated?,"Treatment for psychosis involves using a combination of: antipsychotic medication, psychological therapies, social support."
How can one get help for others with psychosis?,"People with psychosis often have a lack of insight. They're unaware that they're thinking and acting strangely. Because of their lack of insight, it's often down to the friends, relatives, or carers of a person affected by psychosis to seek help for them."
What are the complications of psychosis?,"People with a history of psychosis are much more likely to have drug or alcohol misuse problems, or both. This may be because these substances can provide short-term symptom relief, although they usually make symptoms worse in the long term."
What are pubic lice?,"Pubic lice, also known as crabs, are tiny insects (about 2mm long) that live on coarse human body hair, such as pubic hair. Pubic lice are not linked to poor personal hygiene."
How do you get pubic lice?,"It can take up to 3 weeks after coming into contact with pubic lice before you notice any symptoms. They are spread through close body contact with someone who has them, most commonly sexual contact."
What are the symptoms of pubic lice?,"The most common symptom of pubic lice is itchy red spots. The itching is caused by an allergy to the louse saliva or poo. It can take 1 to 3 weeks for itching to develop after the first infestation, and it'll usually be worse at night."
How is testing done for pubic lice?,"If you think you have pubic lice, make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services. There is no test for lice, but you may see the lice crawling in your body hair. Your GP or sexual health clinic will look for visible evidence of the lice."
What are the treatment options for pubic lice?,Pubic lice can be treated at home with (insecticidal) lotion or cream that will kill the lice. This will usually need to be applied once and repeated after 7 days.
How can one avoid passing on pubic lice to partners?,"If you or your partner has pubic lice, avoid having sex (vaginal, anal or oral) or close bodily contact until you both have finished the course of treatment, including any follow-up treatment."
How can the risk of pubic lice be reduced?,"Pubic lice are easily spread, and condoms don’t protect against them. The only thing that can reduce your risk of getting pubic lice is limiting the number of people with whom you have intimate or sexual contact."
What are rare tumors?,"More children than ever are surviving childhood cancer. There are new and better drugs and treatments, and we can now also work to reduce the after-effects of having had cancer in the past."
What are the types of rare cancers in children?,"Rare cancers in children make up fewer than 1 in 30 of all childhood cancers and can broadly be grouped as: rare cancers that only affect children - cancers that usually only affect adults - rare cancers in the head and neck area - rare hormonal/endocrine cancers - rare brain tumours - rare skin cancers, such as melanomas."
What causes rare tumors?,"The causes of most rare childhood cancers are unknown. But if other family members have had particular types of cancer, this may sometimes suggest that there is an inherited faulty gene in the family. If this is a possibility, your child’s specialist will talk to you about it."
How are rare tumors treated?,"Rare cancers are treated with the same treatments used for other childhood cancers. This includes surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Your child may need a combination of these treatments."
What is Raynaud's phenomenon?,"Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition that affects the blood supply to certain parts of the body – usually the fingers and toes. It's often referred to as Raynaud’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease or just Raynaud's."
Why does Raynaud's phenomenon happen?,"Raynaud’s is usually triggered by cold temperatures, anxiety or stress. The condition occurs because your blood vessels go into a temporary spasm, which blocks the flow of blood."
How is Raynaud's phenomenon treated?,"In many cases, it may be possible to control the symptoms of Raynaud’s yourself by avoiding the cold, wearing gloves and using relaxation techniques when feeling stressed."
What are the types of Raynaud's phenomenon?,There are two types of Raynaud's: primary (when the condition develops by itself (this is the most common type)) and secondary (when it's caused by another health condition).
What are the possible complications of Raynaud's phenomenon?,"Secondary Raynaud’s can severely restrict the blood supply, so it carries a higher risk of complications, such as ulcers, scarring and even tissue death (gangrene) in the most serious cases. However, severe complications are rare."
Who gets Raynaud's phenomenon?,"Raynaud’s phenomenon is a common condition. It affects up to 20% of the adult population worldwide. Primary Raynaud’s usually begins in your 20s or 30s. Secondary Raynaud’s can develop at any age, depending on the cause. Raynaud's is slightly more common in women than men."
What is reactive arthritis?,"Reactive arthritis, formerly known as Reiter's syndrome, is a condition that causes inflammation (redness and swelling) in various places in the body."
What causes reactive arthritis?,"Reactive arthritis usually develops within four weeks of an infection, typically after a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel."
When should someone seek medical advice about reactive arthritis?,"See your GP if you have swollen and painful joints, especially if you have recently had symptoms of an infection such as diarrhoea or pain when passing urine."
How is reactive arthritis treated?,"There is currently no cure for reactive arthritis, but most people get better in around six months. Meanwhile, treatment can help to relieve symptoms such as pain and stiffness."
Who is affected by reactive arthritis?,"Reactive arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects young adults aged 20-40. Men are generally affected more than woman – particularly in cases linked to STIs, which are estimated to be about 10 times more common in men."
How can reactive arthritis be prevented?,The most effective way to reduce your risk of reactive arthritis is to avoid the STIs and bowel infections that most commonly cause the condition.
What is restless legs syndrome?,"Restless legs syndrome, also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common condition of the nervous system that causes an overwhelming, irresistible urge to move the legs."
What causes restless legs syndrome?,"In the majority of cases, there's no obvious cause of restless legs syndrome. This known as idiopathic or primary restless legs syndrome, and it can run in families. Some neurologists (specialists in treating conditions that affect the nervous system) believe the symptoms of restless legs syndrome may have something to do with how the body handles a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in controlling muscle movement and may be responsible for the involuntary leg movements associated with restless legs syndrome."
How is restless legs syndrome treated?,"Mild cases of restless legs syndrome that aren't linked to an underlying health condition may not require any treatment, other than making a few lifestyle changes, such as: adopting good sleep habits , quitting smoking if you smoke, exercising regularly during the daytime"
Who is affected by restless legs syndrome?,"As many as 1 in 10 people are affected by restless legs syndrome at some point in their life. Women are twice as likely to develop restless legs syndrome than men. It's also more common in middle age, although the symptoms can develop at any age, including childhood."
What is retinoblastoma in children?,"Retinoblastoma is an uncommon eye cancer that usually affects children under 5, although it can affect children of any age. Treatment is very effective and nearly all children with retinoblastoma are cured."
What are the causes of retinoblastoma in children?,"The heritable form of retinoblastoma, which accounts for about 2 in every 5 cases, is caused by a genetic abnormality. This means that an abnormal gene allows the tumour to develop. This abnormal gene may either be inherited from a parent or happen for the first time at an early stage of development in the womb."
What are the signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma in children?,"Some children with a family history of retinoblastoma are picked up by screening before they have any symptoms. If there’s no family history of retinoblastoma, the first sign of the condition is often a white pupil that does not reflect light (leukocoria). This may be picked up when a picture of your child is taken using flash photography. The pupil of the affected eye may look white in the photograph."
How is retinoblastoma in children diagnosed?,"Tests are likely to involve an examination under anaesthetic (EUA) where an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) examines your child’s eye while they’re asleep. Unlike nearly all other types of cancer, retinoblastomas can be diagnosed just by their appearance. So it’s not usually necessary to take a sample of tissue (a biopsy). Your child will have several more EUAs to check how treatment is progressing."
How is retinoblastoma in children treated?,"Treatment depends on the number, position and size of the tumours in the eye. The aim of treatment is to first get rid of the cancer, and secondly to try to keep the sight in the eye. Some treatments may cause changes to the vision in the affected eye. Your child’s specialist will talk to you about the possible risks as well as the advantages of the treatment."
What is rhabdomyosarcoma?,Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma (tumour). Most children with rhabdomyosarcoma are younger than 10 years old. It's more common in boys than girls.
What are the causes of rhabdomyosarcoma?,"The causes of rhabdomyosarcoma are unknown but research is going on all the time. Children with certain rare genetic disorders, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, have a higher risk of developing rhabdomyosarcoma."
What are the symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma?,"The most common symptom is a lump or swelling. Other symptoms will depend on the part of the body that’s affected by the rhabdomyosarcoma: a tumour in the head or neck area can sometimes cause a blockage (obstruction) and discharge from the nose or throat; occasionally, an eye may appear swollen and protruding - a tumour in the abdomen (tummy) can cause pain or discomfort in the abdomen and difficulty going to the toilet (constipation) - a tumour in the bladder may cause symptoms such as blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine (peeing)."
How is rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosed?,Different tests are usually needed to diagnose a rhabdomyosarcoma. Your child may need a small operation to remove a sample from the tumour (a biopsy) so that it can be examined under a microscope. This is usually done under a general anaesthetic.
How is rhabdomyosarcoma treated?,"Rhabdomyosarcomas are rare tumours and should be treated at specialist centres. Treatment will depend on the size of the tumour, its position in the body and whether it has spread. The 3 main types of treatment for soft tissue sarcomas are chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy. Your child may have a combination of treatments."
What is rheumatoid arthritis?,"Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term condition that causes pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints. The hands, feet and wrists are commonly affected, but it can also cause problems in other parts of the body."
When should someone seek medical advice about rheumatoid arthritis?,"You should see your GP if you think you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, so your GP can try to identify the underlying cause. Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis quickly is important because early treatment can help stop the condition getting worse and reduce the risk of further problems such as joint damage."
What causes rheumatoid arthritis?,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease. This means that your immune system – which usually fights infection – attacks the cells that line your joints by mistake, making them swollen, stiff and painful."
Who is affected by rheumatoid arthritis?,"It can affect adults at any age, but most commonly starts between the ages of 40 and 50. About three times as many women as men are affected."
How is rheumatoid arthritis treated?,"There is no cure for rheumatoid arthritis, but early diagnosis and appropriate treatment enables many people with rheumatoid arthritis to have periods of months or even years between flares and to be able to lead full lives and continue regular employment."
What are the possible complications of rheumatoid arthritis?,Having rheumatoid arthritis can lead to several other conditions that may cause additional symptoms and can sometimes be life-threatening.
What are ringworm and other fungal infections?,"Ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. Ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Despite its name, ringworm doesn't have anything to do with worms."
What is Tinea fungal infections?,"There are different types of tinea fungal infection, based on the affected area of the body: ringworm (tinea corporis), fungal nail infection (onychomycosis), athlete's foot (tinea pedis), jock itch (tinea cruris), tinea capitis."
When should someone see a doctor about ringworm and other fungal infections?,"See your GP if you or your child has a fungal scalp infection, as it’s treated with antifungal tablets, which are only available on prescription. Symptoms of a fungal scalp infection include small patches of scaly scalp skin (which may be sore), patchy hair loss and itchiness. Other types of fungal infections (including ringworm) are generally treated with antifungal cream from the pharmacy, and you don't need to see a doctor unless it persists. However, pharmacists often prefer children to see a GP to confirm a diagnosis."
What is the cause of ringworm and other fungal infections?,"Fungal spores are passed between people through direct skin contact and by sharing objects such as towels, hairbrushes and bedding. Athlete’s foot is commonly spread in gym and swimming pool changing rooms."
Who is affected by ringworm and other fungal infections?,"It's estimated that 10-20% of people will have ringworm in their lifetime.Although children are more likely to get this, people of all ages can be affected. Groin infections are more common in young men."
How are ringworm and other fungal infections treated?,"Most ringworm infections are mild and can be treated using a pharmacy antifungal cream. Scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes combined with antifungal shampoo. If the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may need treatment with antibiotics. Read more about how to treat fungal infections."
How can the spread of ringworm and other fungal infections be stopped?,"It's important to prevent the infection spreading. You should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection. If you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. If your pet is treated quickly, you’ll be less likely to catch it. If your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should inform their teacher. In addition to treatment, your child should maintain a good level of personal hygiene to prevent the infection spreading. Read more about how to stop the spread of fungal infections."
What is rosacea?,Rosacea is a common but poorly understood long-term skin condition that mainly affects the face.
What are the symptoms of rosacea?,"Symptoms often begin with episodes of flushing, where the skin turns red for a short period, but other symptoms can develop as the condition progresses, such as: burning and stinging sensations, permanent redness, spots (papules and pustules), small blood vessels in the skin becoming visible."
When should someone see their doctor for rosacea?,See your GP if you have persistent symptoms that could be caused by rosacea. Early diagnosis and treatment can help stop the condition getting worse.
What causes rosacea?,"The exact cause of rosacea is unknown, although a number of possible factors have been suggested, including abnormalities in the blood vessels of the face and a reaction to microscopic mites commonly found on the face."
How is rosacea treated?,"There's currently no cure for rosacea, but treatment can help control the symptoms. Long-term treatment is usually necessary, although there may be periods when your symptoms improve and you can stop treatment temporarily."
How can someone live with rosacea?,"Any long-term (chronic) condition can have an adverse psychological effect, but rosacea can be particularly troublesome as it affects your appearance. This can change how you feel about yourself and how you interact with others."
What is ocular rosacea?,"Rosacea that affects your eyes (ocular rosacea) can lead to a number of eye problems, some of which can be serious."
What is scabies?,Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. The main symptom of scabies is intense itching that's worse at night. It also causes a skin rash on areas where the mites have burrowed.
What are scabies mites?,"Scabies mites are called Sarcoptes scabiei. They feed using their mouths and front legs to burrow into the outer layer of skin (epidermis), where they lay eggs. After 3 to 4 days, the baby mites (larvae) hatch and move to the surface of the skin, where they mature into adults."
How is scabies spread?,"Scabies is usually spread through prolonged periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact."
What are scabies outbreaks?,"Scabies is widespread in densely populated areas with limited access to medical care, and is most common in the following tropical and subtropical areas: Africa, Central and South America, northern and central Australia ,Caribbean Islands, India, southeast Asia."
How is scabies treated?,"Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated. The 2 most widely used treatments for scabies are permethrin cream and malathion lotion (brand name Derbac M). Both medications contain insecticides that kill the scabies mite."
What are the complications of scabies?,"Scabies can sometimes lead to a secondary skin infection if your skin becomes irritated and inflamed through excessive itching. Crusted scabies is a rare but more severe form of scabies, where a large number of mites are in the skin. This can develop in older people and those with a lowered immunity."
What is scarlet fever?,"Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash. The illness is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as Group A Streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat."
What are the symptoms of scarlet fever?,"Scarlet fever usually follows a sore throat or a skin infection, like impetigo, caused by particular strains of Streptococcus bacteria. The symptoms of scarlet fever usually develop 2 to 5 days after infection. However, the incubation period (the period between exposure to the infection and symptoms appearing) can be as short as one day or as long as 7 days."
When should someone seek medical advice for scarlet fever?,"If you think you or your child may have scarlet fever, see your GP for a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. It usually clears up after about a week"
How does scarlet fever spread?,"Scarlet fever is very infectious and can be caught by: breathing in bacteria in airborne droplets from an infected person's coughs and sneezes - touching the skin of a person with a Streptococcal skin infection, such as impetigo - sharing contaminated towels, baths, clothes or bed linen."
Who is affected by scarlet fever?,"Most cases of scarlet fever occur in children under 10 (usually between 2 and 8 years of age). However, people of any age can get the illness. As it's easily spread, scarlet fever is likely to affect someone in close contact with a person with a sore throat or skin infection caused by Streptococcus bacteria. Outbreaks can occur in nurseries and schools where children are in close contact with one another."
How is scarlet fever treated?,"Most cases of scarlet fever clear up after about a week without treatment. However, your GP may recommend treatment as it: reduces the length of time you're infectious - speeds up recovery - lowers the risk of complications of scarlet fever."
What are the complications of scarlet fever?,"Most cases of scarlet fever don't cause complications, particularly if the condition is properly treated.However, there's a small risk of the infection spreading to other parts of the body and causing more serious infections."
How can the spread of scarlet fever be prevented?,"There’s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever. If your child has scarlet fever, keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment."
What is Schizophrenia?,"Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of different psychological symptoms, including: hallucinations - delusions - contradict the evidence - muddled thoughts based on hallucinations or delusions - changes in behaviour."
Why does schizophrenia happen?,"The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. However, most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors."
Who is affected by schizophrenia?,"Schizophrenia is one of the most common serious mental health conditions. About 1 in 100 people will experience schizophrenia in their lifetime, with many continuing to lead normal lives. Schizophrenia is most often diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 35. Men and women are affected equally."
How is schizophrenia treated?,"Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy appropriate to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)."
How can someone live with schizophrenia?,"If schizophrenia is well managed, it is possible to reduce the chances of severe relapses. There are many charities and support groups offering help and advice on living with schizophrenia. Most people find it comforting talking to others with a similar condition."
What is scoliosis?,Scoliosis is the abnormal twisting and curvature of the spine. It is usually first noticed by a change in appearance of the back.
When should someone seek medical advice about scoliosis?,"If you or your child have signs of scoliosis, make an appointment to see your GP. They can examine your back and can refer you for an X-ray for confirmation."
What causes scoliosis?,"In around eight out of every 10 cases, a cause for scoliosis is not found. This is known as idiopathic scoliosis. A small number of cases are caused by other medical conditions, including: cerebral palsy - muscular dystrophy - Marfan syndrome."
Who is affected by scoliosis?,"It used to be thought that scoliosis was only a childhood condition, but it’s now increasingly recognised as a condition that affects older adults as well."
How is scoliosis treated?,"Treatment for scoliosis depends on your age, how severe it is, and whether it’s thought it will worsen with time. In very young children, treatment is not always necessary because the curvature of the spine may improve naturally as they get older. If treatment is necessary, bracing or casting may be used to attempt to halt the curve’s progression."
What are the further problems associated with scoliosis?,"Scoliosis can sometimes lead to further emotional and physical problems. Having a visibly curved spine or wearing a back brace can cause problems related to body image, self-esteem and overall quality of life. This is particularly the case for children and teenagers with scoliosis."
What is septic shock?,"Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that happens when your blood pressure drops to a dangerously low level after an infection. Any type of bacteria can cause the infection. Fungi such as candida and viruses can also be a cause, although this is rare."
Who is more at risk of developing septic shock?,People with a weakened immune system have an increased risk of developing septic shock. This includes: newborn babies - elderly people - pregnant women - people with long-term health conditions - people with lowered immune systems.
How is septic shock treated?,You'll usually be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) so your body's functions and organs can be supported while the infection is treated. In some cases treatment may start in the emergency department. Treatment may include: oxygen therapy - fluids given directly through a vein (intravenously) - medication to increase your blood flow - antibiotics - surgery (in some cases).
What are the complications of septic shock?,"The chances of surviving septic shock will depend on:  the cause of infection, the number of organs that have failed, how soon treatment is started. Complications of septic shock can include: inability of the lungs to take in enough oxygen (respiratory failure) - the heart not being able to pump enough blood around the body (heart failure) - kidney failure or injury - abnormal blood clotting."
What is shingles?,"Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it. It's caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causes chickenpox."
What are the symptoms of shingles?,"The main symptom of shingles is pain, followed by a rash that develops into itchy blisters, similar in appearance to chickenpox. New blisters may appear for up to a week, but a few days after appearing they become yellowish in colour, flatten and dry out."
When should someone get professional advice for shingles?,"Shingles isn’t usually serious, but see your pharmacist as soon as possible if you recognise the symptoms. In most cases your pharmacist should be able to provide treatment, however they may recommend that you need to contact your GP practice for treatment if required."
When is referral to the hospital necessary for shingles?,"It's uncommon for someone with shingles to be referred to hospital, but your GP may consider seeking specialist advice if: they suspect a complication of shingles, such as meningitis or encephalitis - shingles is affecting one of your eyes - a diagnosis isn't certain - you have an unusually persistent case of shingles that's not responding to treatment - you've been diagnosed with the condition more than twice - you're pregnant - you have a weakened immune system."
What causes shingles?,"Most people have chickenpox in childhood, but after the illness has gone, the varicella-zoster virus remains dormant (inactive) in the nervous system. The immune system keeps the virus in check, but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles."
Is shingles contagious?,"It's not possible to catch shingles from someone with the condition or from someone with chickenpox. However, you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you haven't had chickenpox before."
How can the spread of the shingles virus be prevented?,"If you have shingles, you're contagious until the last blister has dried and scabbed over. To help prevent the virus being passed on, avoid sharing towels or flannels, swimming, or playing contact sports. You should also avoid work or school if your rash is weeping (oozing fluid) and can't be covered."
How is shingles treated?,"Although there's no cure for shingles, treatment is available to relieve the symptoms until the condition resolves. Most cases of shingles last around two to four weeks."
What are the complications of shingles?,"Shingles can sometimes lead to complications, such as postherpetic neuralgia. This is where severe nerve pain lasts for several months or more after the rash has gone. Complications such as this are usually in elderly people who have had the condition and those with a weakened immune system."
What is the shingles vaccine?,"It's not always possible to prevent shingles, but a vaccine called Zostavax can reduce your chances of developing the condition. If you still develop shingles after having this vaccine, it may be milder and last for a shorter time than usual."
What is ophthalmic shingles?,"Some cases of shingles can affect one of the eyes and are known as ophthalmic shingles. This occurs when the virus is reactivated in part of the trigeminal nerve, a nerve that controls sensation and movement in your face."
What is shortness of breath?,"Sudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnoea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department."
When should someone phone a doctor about shortness of breath?,"You should phone your GP immediately if you have sudden unexpected shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart."
What are the causes of sudden shortness of breath?,Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the references at the end for more information about these conditions.
What are the causes of long-term breathlessness?,"Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by: obesity or being unfit - poorly controlled asthma - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - anaemia - heart failure - a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate) ."
What is sickle cell disease?,"Sickle cell disease is the name for a group of blood disorders. The most severe is sickle cell anaemia. These disorders are inherited, meaning they are passed on through your genes. You can have a blood test at any time to find out if you carry the gene for sickle cell disease, or if you have sickle cell disease."
What is sinusitis?,Sinusitis is a common condition in which the lining of the sinuses becomes inflamed. It's usually caused by a viral infection and often improves within two or three weeks.
What are the signs and symptoms of sinusitis?,"Sinusitis usually occurs after an upper respiratory tract infection, such as a cold. If you have a persistent cold and develop the symptoms below, you may have sinusitis. Symptoms of sinusitis include: a green or yellow discharge from your nose - a blocked nose - pain and tenderness around your cheeks, eyes or forehead - a sinus headache - a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or more - toothache - a reduced sense of smell - bad breath (halitosis)."
When should someone see their doctor for sinusitis?,"If your symptoms are mild and getting better, you don't usually need to see your GP and can look after yourself at home. See your GP if your symptoms are severe or getting worse or your symptoms haven't started to improve after around 7-10 days or you experience episodes of sinusitis frequently."
How is sinusitis treated?,"Most people with sinusitis will feel better within two or three weeks and can look after themselves at home. If your symptoms aren't improving or are getting worse, your GP may prescribe antibiotics or corticosteroid spray or drops to see if they help."
What causes sinusitis?,Sinusitis is usually the result of a cold or flu virus spreading to the sinuses from the upper airways. Only a few cases are caused by bacteria infecting the sinuses. An infected tooth or fungal infection can also occasionally cause the sinuses to become inflamed.
What is Sjogren's syndrome?,"Sjögren's (pronounced Show-grin's) syndrome is an autoimmune disorder. The body’s immune system attacks glands that secrete fluid, such as the tear and saliva glands."
What causes Sjogren's syndrome?,"Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune condition, which means that instead of protecting the body from infection or illness, the immune system reacts abnormally and starts attacking healthy cells and tissue. In Sjögren's syndrome, the immune system attacks the tear and saliva glands, and other secretory glands throughout the body."
How is Sjogren's syndrome diagnosed?,"Sjögren's syndrome can be difficult to diagnose, because it has similar symptoms to other conditions and there is no single test for it."
How is Sjogren's syndrome treated?,"There is no cure for Sjögren's syndrome, but treatments can help control symptoms. Dry eyes and mouth can usually be helped with artificial tears and saliva."
What are the complications of Sjogren's syndrome?,"Sjögren's syndrome can sometimes lead to complications. For example, your eyesight could be permanently damaged if the reduced tear production isn't treated."
Who is affected by Sjogren's syndrome?,"Sjögren's syndrome most commonly affects people aged 40-60, with women accounting for about 90% of cases. It’s difficult to know exactly how many people are affected by the syndrome because many don't see their GP about their symptoms."
What is melanoma?,"Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body. The most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing mole. This can happen anywhere on the body, but the back, legs, arms and face are most commonly affected."
What is nodular melanoma?,"Nodular melanoma is a fast-developing type of melanoma, most common in middle-aged people. It may not develop from an existing mole and can appear in areas of skin that aren't regularly exposed to the sun."
What is lentigo maligna melanoma?,Lentigo maligna melanoma is most common in elderly people and those who have spent a lot of time outdoors. It is common on the face and tends to grow slowly over a number of years.
What is acral lentiginous melanoma?,Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that usually appears on the palms of the hands and the soles or big toenails of the feet. This is the most common type of melanoma in people with dark skin.
Why does melanoma happen?,Melanoma happens when some cells in the skin begin to develop abnormally. It's thought that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light from natural or artificial sources may be partly responsible.
How is melanoma diagnosed?,Speak to your GP if you notice any change to your moles. Your GP will refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma.
How is melanoma treated?,"The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances. If melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful."
Who is affected by melanoma?,"Melanoma is the 5th most common cancer in the UK. More than a quarter of cases are diagnosed in people under 50, which is unusual compared to most other types of cancer. It's also becoming more common in the UK over time, thought to be caused by increased exposure to UV light from the sun and sunbeds."
Can melanoma be prevented?,"Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by limiting your exposure to UV light. You can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun. Sunbeds and sunlamps should also be avoided."
What is non-melanoma skin cancer?,Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world. Non-melanoma skin cancer refers to a group of cancers that slowly develop in the upper layers of the skin.
What are the types of non-melanoma skin cancer?,Non-melanoma skin cancers usually develop in the outermost layer of skin (epidermis) and are often named after the type of skin cell from which they develop.
Why does non-melanoma skin cancer happen?,"Non-melanoma skin cancer is mainly caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light comes from the sun, as well as artificial sunbeds and sunlamps."
Who is affected by non-melanoma skin cancer?,Non-melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer in the world. It affects slightly more men than women.
How is non-melanoma skin cancer diagnosed?,Your GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer. They may refer you to a skin specialist (dermatologist) or a specialist plastic surgeon if they are unsure or suspect skin cancer.
How is non-melanoma skin cancer treated?,"Surgery is the main treatment for non-melanoma skin cancer. This involves removing the cancerous tumour and some of the surrounding skin. Other treatments for non-melanoma skin cancer include cryotherapy, creams, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and a treatment known as photodynamic therapy (PDT)."
What are the complications of non-melanoma skin cancer?,"If you have had non-melanoma skin cancer in the past, there is a chance the condition may return. The chance of non-melanoma skin cancer returning is increased if your previous cancer was widespread and severe."
How can non-melanoma skin cancer be prevented?,"Non-melanoma skin cancer is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing the condition by avoiding overexposure to UV light."

Unless you or your child is feeling unwell, there’s no need to stay away from school or work once the rash has developed, as the infection is no longer contagious by this point."
How is slapped cheek syndrome transmitted?,Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus called parvovirus B19. This is found in the droplets in the coughs and sneezes of someone with the infection.
How can slapped cheek syndrome be prevented?,"It's very difficult to prevent slapped cheek syndrome, because people who have the infection are most contagious before they develop any obvious symptoms."
What is soft tissue sarcoma?,"Soft tissue sarcomas are a group of rare cancers affecting the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures and organs. Tissues that can be affected by soft tissue sarcomas include fat, muscle, blood vessels, deep skin tissues, tendons and ligaments."

What are Spleen problems and spleen removal? ,"The spleen is a fist-sized organ found in the upper left side of your abdomen, next to your stomach and behind your left ribs. It is an important part of your immune system but you can survive without it. This is because the liver can take over many of the spleen's functions."
What does the spleen do?,"The spleen has a few important functions. It fights any invading germs in the blood (the spleen contains infection-fighting white blood cells). It controls the level of blood cells. The spleen controls the level of white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets (small cells that form blood clots)."
What are the spleen problems?,Spleen problems : Spleen pain - A damaged or ruptured spleen - Enlarged spleen .
What is splenectomy?,"An operation to remove the spleen, known as a splenectomy, may be needed if the spleen is damaged, diseased or enlarged. It may sometimes be more appropriate to have just part of your spleen removed – a partial splenectomy."
How is life without a spleen?,"If your spleen needs to be removed, other organs such as the liver can take over many of the spleen's functions.

What are some considerations for living with stomach cancer?,"Living with stomach cancer and the effects of surgery can be tough, but there are a range of services that can provide social, psychological and financial support."
What is stomach ulcers?,Stomach ulcers (gastric ulcers) are open sores that develop on the lining of the stomach. Ulcers can also occur in part of the intestine just beyond the stomach. These are called duodenal ulcers.
What are the symptoms of stomach ulcers?,Although the most common symptom of a stomach ulcer is a burning or gnawing pain in the centre of the abdomen (tummy). Not all stomach ulcers are painful.
What causes stomach ulcers?,Stomach ulcers occur when the layer protecting the stomach lining from stomach acid breaks down. This allows the stomach lining to become damaged.
How are stomach ulcers treated?,You'll be treated using antibiotics if your ulcer was caused by a H. pylori infection. This kills the bacteria and should prevent the ulcer coming back.
What are the complications of stomach ulcers?,"Complications are rare but can be very serious and potentially life-threatening. The main complications include: bleeding at the site of the ulcer, the stomach lining at the site of the ulcer splits open, the ulcer blocks the movement of food through the digestive system."
What are Streptococcus A infections?,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also known as Strep A, are bacteria commonly found on the skin or in the throat. Under some circumstances these bacteria can cause disease."

What are iGAS infections?,"GAS can very rarely cause more serious conditions, known as invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infections. iGAS infections tend to happen in the elderly, the very young, or people with an underlying risk factor such as injecting drug use, alcoholism, immunosuppression or cancer."
How are GAS infections treated?,"Often symptoms that look like GAS infections, like sore throats, are more commonly caused by viruses than GAS bacteria. If you or your child has a runny nose with their sore throat, it's likely to be a virus infection. Sore throats caused by viruses do not need to be treated with antibiotics unless there are concerns about complications."
How can GAS infections be prevented?,"GAS are spread by close contact between individuals, through respiratory droplets (moisture in your breath) and direct skin contact."
What is stroke?,"A stroke is a serious, life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. Strokes are a medical emergency and urgent treatment is essential. The sooner a person receives treatment for a stroke, the less damage to the brain is likely to occur."
What are the signs and symptoms of a stroke?,"The main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST. FAST stands for : Face (the face might drop on one side, the person may not be able to smile or their mouth may have dropped, and their eyelid may droop), Arms ( the person may not be able to lift both arms and keep them there because of arm weakness or numbness in one arm), Speech ( they might slur their speech or it might be garbled, or the person may not be able to talk at all despite appearing to be awake), Time ( it’s time to phone 999 immediately if you see any of these signs or symptoms)."
Why do strokes happen?,"Like all organs, the brain needs the oxygen and nutrients provided by blood to function. If the supply of blood is restricted or stopped, brain cells begin to die. This can lead to brain injury, disability and possibly death. There are 2 main causes of strokes: ischaemic (where the blood supply is stopped due to a blood clot (this accounts for 85% of all cases)), haemorrhagic (where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts)."
"What is a ""mini-stroke"" or transient ischaemic attack?","The symptoms of a TIA are the same as a stroke, but they only last between a few minutes and a few hours before disappearing completely."
Who is at risk of a stroke?,"Lifestyle changes can help control some of these risk factors. You may also need to take regular medication. Taking anticoagulant medication if you have an irregular heartbeat due to atrial fibrillation will help reduce the risk of stroke. If you've had a stroke or TIA, these measures are very important because you're at a higher risk of having another stroke."
How is a stroke diagnosed?,Strokes are usually diagnosed by physical tests and studying scans of the brain. Some tests can help confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause of the stroke.
How are strokes treated?,Effective treatment of stroke can reduce the risk of long-term disability and save lives. The specific treatments recommended depend on whether a stroke is caused by: a blood clot obstructing the flow of blood to the brain (ischaemic stroke) and a burst blood vessel bleeding in or around the brain (haemorrhagic stroke).
What is life like after a stroke?,The brain injury caused by a stroke can lead to long-lasting problems. Some people who've had a stroke need long-term rehabilitation to help them regain as much independence as possible.
How can someone care for a person who has had a stroke?,"Around half the people who have a stroke will need some form of care or help with their daily activities. For example, a care worker could come to the person's home to help with household tasks, or to provide companionship."
What are the recommendations for safe sleeping practices?,"For the first 6 months of your baby's life the safest place for them to sleep is in a cot in the same room as the person looking after them, for all sleeps."

How can someone help their baby sleep safely?,"For the first 6 months the safest place for your baby to sleep is in a cot, crib or moses basket in your room beside your bed and in the same room as you, for all sleeps. You'll also be close by if they need a feed or cuddle."
Is it safe to share a bed with a baby?,"Adult beds aren't designed for babies. Before you bed-share, consider whether you think it's a safe place for your baby to sleep. Mothers do sometimes bed-share when breastfeeding, however, without some planning and thought it can be very dangerous."
What is considered a normal amount of sleep?,There’s no normal amount of sleep and some babies sleep more than others. New babies sleep a lot – sometimes as much as 18 hours a day for the first month or so. But your baby probably won’t sleep for more than a few hours at a time to begin with.
What should someone do if their baby is crying excessively?,"When your baby cries and you go to them and comfort them, you're teaching them the world's a safe place. This helps them to develop the skills to sleep through the night."
What is plagiocephaly?,Sometimes babies develop a flatter area either at the back of or on one side of their head. This is called plagiocephaly. Plagiocephaly usually gets better on its own if your baby's spending less time lying down.
What is Sunburn?,"Sunburn is skin damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) rays. It usually causes the skin to become red, sore, warm, tender and occasionally itchy for about a week."

How can sunburn be prevented?,"Skin should be protected from strong sunlight by covering up with suitable clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen. There is also a risk of getting sunburn in other weather conditions – for example, light reflecting off snow can also cause sunburn. You can also burn in cloudy and cool conditions."
What are the recommendations for sunburn prevention in babies and children?,"Children aged under six months should be kept out of direct strong sunlight. To ensure they get enough vitamin D, children aged under five are advised to take vitamin D supplements even if they do get out in the sun."
What is the significance of swollen glands?,"Swollen lymph glands are usually a sign of infection and tend to go down when you recover. However, they can sometimes have a more serious cause and may need to be seen by a doctor."
How is the cause of swollen glands diagnosed?,"If necessary, your GP may request some tests to help identify the cause of swollen glands. These can include: blood tests, an ultrasound scan, a computerised tomography (CT) scan, a biopsy (where a small sample of fluid is taken from the swelling and tested)."
What are the common causes of swollen glands?,"Swollen glands are usually caused by a relatively minor viral or bacterial infection, including: a cold, tonsillitis, glandular fever, a throat infection, an ear infection, a dental abscess, cellulitis (a skin infection)."
What are some less common causes of swollen glands?,"Less often, swollen glands may be the result of: rubella, measles, cytomegalovirus (CMV), tuberculosis (TB), syphilis, cat scratch disease, HIV (a virus that attacks the immune system and weakens your ability to fight infections), lupus (where the immune system starts to attack the body's joints, skin, blood cells and organs), rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis (where small patches of red and swollen tissue, called granulomas, develop in the organs of the body)."
How are swollen glands typically treated?,"When an infection causes swollen glands you can help to ease symptoms at home. like drink plenty of fluids, rest, use over-the-counter medicines like paracetamol or ibuprofen."
Could swollen glands indicate the presence of cancer?,"Occasionally, swollen glands can be a sign of cancer that has started elsewhere in the body and spread to the lymph nodes, or a type of cancer affecting the white blood cells, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia."
What is Syphilis?,Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacteria. It can be serious if it's left untreated or passed on to a baby during pregnancy or childbirth.
How is syphilis transmitted?,"Syphilis is usually spread by contact between moist skin areas anywhere on or inside the body. Some of the ways you can catch it include: unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex (without a condom) - kissing or licking the anus - sharing sex toys that aren't washed or covered with a new condom each time they're used - your genitals coming into contact with your partner's genitals ."
What are the symptoms of syphilis?,Many people with syphilis will not notice any symptoms either at the time of infection or later.
What tests are available for diagnosing syphilis?,"If you think you may have syphilis, you should make an appointment with your GP or local sexual health services. The only reliable way to tell if you have syphilis or not is to have a blood test. This is usually sent to the lab. However in some sexual health services a same day test can be done if you have symptoms."
How is syphilis treated?,"Early syphilis infections can be easily treated with antibiotics (usually penicillin), even during pregnancy. In late stage syphilis infections, treatment at any time can stop further illness and cure the infection itself, though it does not repair any damaged organs."
What precautions should be taken to prevent passing syphilis to a partner?,"This will stop you from infecting your partner if they're clear, and stop you being re-infected if they also have syphilis. Your partner should also get tested for syphilis. It can be hard to spot in its early stages and they might not realise they have it. They will generally be offered treatment regardless."
How does syphilis affect pregnancy?,Syphilis can be passed to a baby during pregnancy and childbirth. All pregnant women in Scotland are offered a syphilis test. It can be successfully treated during pregnancy with a course of antibiotics. The treatment does not harm the unborn baby.
What can be done to reduce the risk of syphilis?,"The best way to prevent all sexually transmitted infections is to practice safer sex. This means using a condom for vaginal, anal or oral sex."
What is testicular cancer?,Cancer of the testicle is one of the less common cancers. It tends to mostly affect men and anyone with testicles between 15 and 49 years of age.

What is testicles?,It can be embarrassing to talk about your testicles and any changes to them that you’ve noticed. Understanding more about what they do might help.
What important facts should be known about the testicles?,"Testicles are small and oval-shaped. They hang below your penis in a sac called the scrotum. From puberty, your testicles produce a hormone called testosterone. This gives you a lower voice, hair on your face and body, and makes your muscles get bigger. You also need it for your sex drive and for getting an erection."
What role do lymph nodes play in testicular health?,"Lymph nodes are small and round, and connect to each other by tiny tubes that carry fluid called lymph. We have lymph nodes throughout our bodies. They are part of the lymphatic system, which protects us from infections."

They are: papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Papillary and follicular carcinomas are sometimes known as differentiated thyroid cancers, and they're often treated in the same way."
How common is thyroid cancer?,"It's most common in people aged 35 to 39 years and in those aged 70 years or over. Women are 2 to 3 times more likely to develop thyroid cancer than men. It's unclear why this is, but it may be a result of the hormonal changes associated with the female reproductive system."
What are the known causes of thyroid cancer?,"In most cases, the cause of thyroid cancer is unknown. However, certain things can increase your chances of developing the condition."
How is thyroid cancer diagnosed?,"A type of blood test known as a thyroid function test will measure the hormone levels in your blood and rule out or confirm other thyroid problems. If nothing else seems to be causing the lump in your thyroid, fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is used."
How is thyroid cancer treated?,"Your recommended treatment plan will depend on the type and grade of your cancer, and whether a complete cure is realistically achievable."
Can thyroid cancer recur?,"Cancerous cells will return in an estimated 5% to 20% of people with a history of thyroid cancer. In approximately 10% to 15% of people, the cancerous cells will come back in other parts of their body, such as their bones."
What measures can be taken to prevent thyroid cancer?,"From the available evidence, eating a healthy, balanced diet is the best way to avoid getting thyroid cancer and all other types of cancer."
What is the introduction of thyroid cancer in teenagers and young adults?,Papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are the most common types of thyroid cancer in young adults.

Sometimes a parent or carer may feel a lump in the abdomen which can be quite large. Occasionally, the tumour may bleed slightly and this can irritate the kidney and may be painful. There may be blood in your child’s urine (pee), or their blood pressure may be raised. The child may also have a high temperature (fever), upset stomach, weight loss or a lack of appetite."
How is Wilms tumor diagnosed?,"A variety of tests and investigations may be needed to diagnose a Wilms’ tumour. An abdominal ultrasound scan is usually the first thing that is done. This will be followed by an MRI and/or CT scan of the abdomen and chest. These scans help doctors to identify exactly where the tumour is and whether it has spread beyond the kidney. This is known as staging. Urine and blood samples will also be taken to check your child’s kidney function and general health. Most children will go on to have a biopsy, where a sample of tissue is taken from the tumour to confirm the diagnosis. Any tests and investigations that your child needs will be explained to you."
What are the treatment options for Wilms tumor?,"Treatment is planned by specialists in children’s tumours and cancers. This is usually based in a children’s oncology unit within a main hospital, but some treatment may be given closer to home. Treatment will depend on a number of factors including how the cells appear under the microscope (histology) and the stage of the tumour. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery."
